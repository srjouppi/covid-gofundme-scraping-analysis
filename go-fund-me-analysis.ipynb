    "\n",
    "This dataset comes from my scrape of selective go fund me queries. Selective in the fact that I was searching for campaigns for those diagnosed with COVID. This is not a full population but a sample. Go Fund Me would only serve me 1,000 results per query.\n",
    "\n",
    "So my question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can I use this data because it is not comprehensive?\n",
    "* If so, how do I talk about it?\n",
    "* If not, I'd like to decide that now and pivot to focusing on to Story Idea B: The Cost of COVID in New York, a cost comparison analysis of the hospitals in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Do's\n",
    "- This data also needs some cleaning, to filter out any non-Covid related posts that may have snuck in.\n",
    "- I need to hone in on the story I want to tell\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My story\n",
    "\n",
    "My focus will be on hospital stays. I can use regex to try to pull out days or weeks for as many campaigns as I can and write about what I found. Once I clean the data, I would like to try to compare the goals of gofundme campaigns with the length of the hospital stay. I'd like to look closer at the descriptions and see if I can draw out any more insightful information about their experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that I have chargemaster data, and codes related to COVID stays, I would like to pick a few of the common codes, like ICU stay or 96+ hours on a ventilator, etc, and provide mean charges for those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge will be the comparison. Can I select a few hospitals in some of the major areas rerpesented in this dataset? That feels like shaky comparison. Perhaps I can't include that at all?\n"

With a virus as deadly as COVID-19, we were unsure this would be happening for us. I'm here today to share my dad's story and our current dilemma.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>From a very early age, Miguel knew he was good at being a salesman. While other kids had dreams of becoming doctors or lawyers, he knew he wanted to own a small business. He married his high school sweetheart on a whim and rapidly began working to provide for his growing family. Miguel eventually landed a job at Pan American in Edinburg, Texas. It was there where his boss took him under his wings and taught him the ins and outs of running a business. In 1982 Miguel took that knowledge and started United Restaurant Supply. With a mere $700, he began selling kitchenware out of his garage and at local flea markets. Miguel would even send his kids to school with small kitchen items to sell to their teachers, determined to grow his business. With a stubborn determination for success, it didn't take long for United to skyrocket. United Restaurant Supply and providing for his family were the two most important things to him.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>United closed its doors in December after my dad contracted COVID-19. For the last six months, We've been able to take care of our parent's home and our mom. My dad woke from his two-month coma in February. He's been slowly recovering since then. Medicare was able to cover most of his expenses up until May. We have begun receiving medical bills that are more than we can chew. While my dad is coming home, we are now left with the urgency to pay for his expenses not covered by medicare. They are roughly piling up to $15,000. We're asking for your help to allow my father the freedom of not worrying about providing for my mom or paying his medical bills. As a family, our biggest priority is to help his recovery physically and mentally from this experience. On behalf of my family, I want to thank you for your time and consideration.

       " \"I am reaching out to my roller family and our community to help DISCO BALL EVENTS survive the financial hardships the COVID shutdowns have inevitably caused. As a business owner of a recreational/non essential type of establishment admitting that our roller rink is at risk due to financial hardship is difficult but the survival of our Roller Rink is more important than maintaining appearances.<br />At a time when our world needs support in all arenas I am putting the call out for help to all those who love what DISCO BALL EVENTS is and offers for our community, and those who believe it is a worthwhile investment to ensure our families, to have a local, safe, and welcoming place to have fun and socialize.<br /><br />I know the common misconception of the entertainment business industry, those whose main purpose is for enjoyment purposes, might seem like a lucrative endeavor - but over the past 2.5 years it has been quite a struggle as we opened a mere three months before the pandemic hit. I have been personally funding and fueling what you know today as DISCO BALL EVENTS. I invested all I have and will have in this venture. With the COVID shut downs and restrictions small businesses like mine are stretched to the limit and desperately need the support of our community.<br /><br />I opened this GoFundMe as a way to avoid closer. As a business owner of a recreational/non essential type of establishment I find asking for donations difficult.<br />We all know there are much more pressing and urgent world crisis and causes to support in this hard world.<br /><br />This GoFundMe as a way to support the continued efforts I am making along side my staff to keep roller skating alive.<br /><br />The pandemic shut downs and restrictions will require a long recovery and I am asking for our supporters to donate to help enable our recovery possible.<br /><br />Most of the shutdowns occur during our peak time, thus we missed quite a bit of income opportunity and DISCO BALL EVENTS is now struggling under a daunting mountain of debt and bills. The business to business relationships must continue as we support local and they support us. We are forever grateful that they have been so flexible to date but we need help to kick start our recovery and get us back to where we should be had this pandemic not hit us with so many shut downs.<br /><br />DISCO BALL EVENTS vision is to continue with fun interactive activities for everyone. To us roller skating is always about EQUALITY, INCLUSION and ACCEPTANCE. Our success is because you also see the magic of roller skating to music and the roller community is growing strong. We'd like to keep it going with your donations.<br /><br />Your donations will help provide financial relief for Jay Bradley (Owner) to take care of outstanding operational bills such as heating, roller skate misc parts inventory, retail inventory, venue rental, outstanding staff wages and ensure we can continue to grow and be the place our community gathers together.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for your support. As we have done with our Saturday afternoon fundraising partnerships from our beginnings 2.5 years ago, We look forward to paying back to the community once COVID is finally in our rear view mirror.<br /><br /><br />Jay Bradley, President<br />DISCO BALL EVENTS rollerskating<br />170 York Street<br />Napanee, Ontario\",\n",

       " 'Our dear friend Maya Reynolds and her inspiring business CLADE need our help. On Saturday, May 30th, CLADE’s window was smashed and her DTLA store was looted.\\xa0 You can see how devastating just 40 seconds of looting is- here\\'s video of just the first round of vandalization:<br /><br /><iframe media_type=\"0\" media_id=\"54-AL_dmQHE\" class=\"youtube-replace\" title=\"YouTube video player\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px;width:560px;height:315px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/54-AL_dmQHE/?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"1\"></iframe>There are many layers of tragedy here. The first is the injustice that Black Americans face every day. In no way does the looting of CLADE come close to the challenges these communities face and in no way does the looting change any of our resolve towards freedom and equity for all. Right off the bat, know that 10% of all money raised for Maya and CLADE will go to the <a href=\"https://ncbw.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Coalition of 100 Black Women</a>\\xa0, which raises money for Black women in small business.<br /><br />The break-in also affected the other artisans that Maya supported in her shop- it wasn’t just her work that was stolen, but the work of others. It is a primary goal of Maya’s to make these artists whole. Finally, this robbery fell after 3 months of pandemic-related economic crisis that so many businesses have been experiencing.<strong><br />BEFORE:<br /><img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48586356_1591397911248684_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48586356_1591397911248684_r.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" media_type=\"3\" /><br />AFTER:<br /></strong><img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48586356_1591398252712408_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48586356_1591398252712408_r.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" media_type=\"3\" /><br />In my conversations with Maya, I have been impressed how she is not wallowing in the past or the emotional violation, but is resolute in making others whole and moving CLADE forward.

       " '\\n<p>Hi Friends,<br /><br />I\\'ve started a GoFundMe for my\\xa0good friends, the Nielsen Family. As some of\\xa0you may know, Paul contracted COVID-19and has been sick since April 22, 2020. He spent a week in the hospital fighting to get better. He is still recovering from the <br />after-effects of the virus which include\\xa0<span style=\"font-size:1.0625rem;\">fatigue, low blood pressure and low oxygen.</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Paul is a self-employed contractor of a small business. The family does not qualify for unemployment or small business help, and \\xa0they have no health insurance or sick pay. \\xa0They estimate that they need around $5,000 \\xa0to help to get through the next couple of months with medical bills/supplies and household bills, as they will only have minimal income in June and July from Edie\\'s part-time \\xa0job. Paul hopes to start working a little in June and ramp-up to a normal\\xa0schedule as he hopefully heals by the end of June/early July. <br /><br />Paul, Edie and Dasha need our help, so I hope you will consider donating. I would love nothing more than to call Edie and Paul in a few days to tell them that people have rallied around them, and funds are available. Please share this link with friends and family (any amount will help). <br /><br />Thank you for your prayers, your support and <br />for being willing to touch their lives and make a difference when they need it most!\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Heather Dedrick\\n</p>',\n",
       " 'My dad is in the hospital due to being infected with COVID-19. He’s a podiatrist, and instead of scaling back on work during quarantine, he insisted on taking his normal number of patients to help alleviate the strain on urgent care and emergency room facilities. He worked with the best PPE he had available, sometimes seeing up to 30 patients in one day. Within the past two weeks he contracted the virus. He was admitted into the hospital on 7/3 due to mild complications but his symptoms are currently being managed.<br /><br />My dad has served Southern California as a podiatrist since 1985. He has helped patients all over the area, mainly in Downey, Pasadena, Brawley and Calexico. Anyone who has ever met my dad knows he’s one of the sweetest, funniest people, who is likely to just hand you a bowl of ice cream or a popsicle if you’re in the room with him for long enough :P<br /><br />Many of his patients have been going to him for decades. He has worked in group homes with neurodivergent, disabled, and elderly patients. They’re often excited by his visits because they look forward to interacting with a doctor who treats them with respect and dignity. This also extends to those who speak English as a second language, which makes up a majority of his patients. Some have thanked him for not speaking down to them or making them feel like their accents or grammar mistakes make them less important. He has worked in medical centers where patients wait hours and hours to see him specifically, while turning down other doctors who were available. This is how much of an impact he makes on his patients and he doesn’t even realize how much his kindness is valued in the community.<br /><br />I would like to do something nice for my dad during this time and let him know how much he is appreciated, not as a direct frontline worker, but as a part of the integral support system of medical workers holding up COVID-19 doctors--a system he is now personally relying on to take care of him. He has worked for 35 years running a small practice and rarely taking vacations. He has done nothing but give to his children and wife to make sure we have always had what we needed in spite of hardships he has experienced as a small business owner.\\xa0<br /><br />If you are willing to donate $1, and most importantly a positive message for my dad, it would mean the world to me. I would love for my dad to overcome this virus and be able to read all your messages as well as have a gift from the community to be able to do something nice for himself. I want to be clear that this is not for medical expenses, and is just a way to say thank you for the decades of positivity he has brought to his community, and offer well wishes for a speedy recovery.<br /><br />Thank you in advance to anyone who contributes!<br /><br />Maya',\n",

When covid first struck she was terrified. The common cold for us, could mean weeks at the hospital for her. \\xa0Turns out she didn’t have to worry right away as the governor shut down her business in the first round of shut downs. She couldn’t file unemployment, she was a self employed small business. She didn’t qualify for the SBA for the same reason. She lost months of income. When the day finally came that she could <font color=\"#333333\">re-open she was clear, you must wear a mask and if you might be sick please cancel, she couldn’t afford to get sick. However she contracted covid regardless, she had only been to\\xa0work and home. She ended up in the hospital for days. Then had to go home and recover. \\xa0More lost income. Now what she is facing is thousands in medical debt that renown isn’t willing to help with. They are for profit and don’t care about little people like her.

       " '\\n<p><strong>ENGLISH</strong><br /><br />Hello dear friends, family, and all the kind people who have reached this page to read the story of our loving father, Luis Naranjo.<br /><br />Our family consists of 6 members: our parents Carmen and Luis, and their children Adrian, Priscila, Alvaro, and Paola.<br /><br />Adrian and Priscila have their own small families, with two young sons each.<br /><br />Our father has always been very loving, responsible, and committed. He arrived in the United States over 30 years ago and has not stopped working ever since to help provide care and support for his family.<br /><br />Due to the economic crises that our country was subjected to in the 80s and 90s, our father was forced to emigrate from Ecuador to the city of New York in search of a better life and in pursuit of the American dream. Our mother would join him a few years later. We were separated for over 15 years before finally being reunited and having the opportunity to live together in the United States.<br /><br />Our father has worked endlessly in various occupations, however, for the past 20 years, he has been a small business owner in the heart of Manhattan located in the Diamond District. He has a small jewelry company where jewelry is beautifully crafted before being displayed throughout stores on 5th Avenue.<br /><br />Our father’s business, F&amp;N Jewelry Corporation, employs between 7 to 12 people depending on the commercial season.\\xa0<br /><br />In the second week of March, our father began developing symptoms, high fever and body aches, that at the time we all believed to be the flu. At the same time, our parents and sister Paola, who lives with them, began taking precautions and self-isolated in their shared apartment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his symptoms worsened and his fever did not decline for several days, he had no appetite and had developed a persistent cough. My sisters took immediate action and called all the available authorized numbers seeking help and guidance. On March 19th, my sister Paola took our father to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was kept overnight. He was discharged the next morning with a positive test result for COVID-19 with developed pneumonia, he was ordered to self-quarantine, take Tylenol and consistently drink fluids.<br /><br />By Sunday, March 22th, his condition declined, with his cough worsening and having extreme difficulty breathing, Paola inevitably rushed him back to the hospital for the second time. Late that afternoon we would receive one of the worst news. The hospital had called our sister Priscila to communicate that our father was rushed to the ICU with a collapsed right lung and had to be intubated with a ventilator.<br /><br />Ever since that night, even to this day, our entire family gathers together for a video call to pray for his recovery as well as the health and safety of all patients, nurses, doctors, and all those who are risking their own lives to fight against this terrible virus.\\xa0<br /><br />Our father was in the ICU and on the ventilator for 14 days, receiving the best care at Mount Sinai Hospital where he was included in a clinical trial where he would receive an experimental stem cell therapy. Although we might never know if the stem cell treatment helped in his recovery, we are certain that his will to live and strength to fight helped him prevail, be extubated, and removed from the ICU.<br /><br />On April 10th, after being hospitalized for a total of 21 days, our father was discharged and was able to return home.<br /><br />Our father, today, finds himself home next to our mother and Paola, being informed by the doctors that he awaits a slow recovery for the next 6 to 8 months until his physical health can improve.<br /><br />During the time he was in the hospital, and similarly to hundreds of thousands of small businesses, we were not able to acquire any financial loan, grant, or help from the United States Government.<br /><br />On average, the monthly operating expenses of our parents business totals $25,576.53 of which is distributed primarily to payroll (69%, 7 employees), rent (14.5%), and the remaining payable accounts such as basic services, suppliers, credit line, etc (16.5%).<br /><br />None of these bills have been paid, and given the non-essential nature of the business, the company has been non-operating as imposed by the Governor of New York.<br /><br />For this reason, we are reaching out to our friends to seek your generosity and to raise $25,000 that would help tremendously to our father’s business as well as provide overdue relief to his employees and their families.<br /><br />Thank you so much for your time, undivided attention, and generosity.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>SPANISH</strong><br /><br /><br />Hola queridos amigos, familiares y todas las amables personas que han llegado hasta aquí a leer la historia de nuestro querido padre Luis Naranjo. <br /><br />En nuestra familia somos 6 miembros: nuestros padres Carmen y Luis y sus hijos Adrián, Priscila, Alvaro y Paola.\\xa0<br /><br />Adrián y Priscila tenemos nuestra pequeña familia con dos hijos cada uno.\\xa0<br /><br />Nuestro padre es muy amoroso, responsable y comprometido. Llegó a Estados Unidos hace mas de 30 años y desde entonces no ha parado de trabajar para cuidar y sacar adelante a su familia como lo ha hecho hasta ahora. <br /><br />Por las crisis económicas nuestro padre y unos años después nuestra madre se vieron obligados a emigrar del Ecuador hacia la ciudad de Nueva York y nos separamos por mas de 15 años, luego de todo ese tiempo felizmente pudimos reencontrarnos y vivir todos juntos en Estados Unidos. <br /><br />Nuestro papá ha trabajado incansablemente en muchos lugares pero desde hace 20 años es el dueño de un pequeño negocio en el corazón de Manhattan, en el distrito del diamante. Su negocio es un taller de joyería donde se realizan bellas joyas que adornan las tiendas de la 5ta avenida.\\xa0<br /><br />En el negocio de mi padre, F&amp;N Jewelry Corporation, colaboran entre 7 y 12 personas dependiendo de la temporada comercial, es un pequeño negocio familiar.<br /><br />La segunda semana de Marzo nuestro padre inició a desarrollar síntomas de lo que pensamos era una gripe, tenía fiebre y malestar general del cuerpo. Al mismo tiempo iniciaron las medidas de distanciamiento social por lo que mis padres y Paola, quienes viven juntos, guardaron aislamiento en casa.\\xa0<br /><br />Los síntomas\\xa0 empeoraron, la fiebre no bajó en varios días, su apetito desapareció e inició un cuadro de tos. Mis hermanas actuaron rápidamente, llamaron a los números autorizados y Paola llevó a mi padre al hospital el 19 de Marzo donde pasó la noche, al día siguiente fue dado de alta con la noticia de que sus exámenes dieron positivo para Coronavirus y que debía permanecer aislado, tomar Tylenol y beber muchos líquidos.\\xa0<br /><br />Para el día Domingo 22 de Marzo su condición empeoró, tenía mas tos y se dificultaba su respiración, nuevamente Paola llevó a nuestro padre al hospital. Mas tarde ese día tendríamos una mala noticia. Llamaron a Priscila del Hospital para indicarnos que ingresarían a papá a una unidad de cuidados intensivos y lo intubarían en un respirador.\\xa0<br /><br />Desde esa noche hasta el día de hoy nos reunimos todas las noches en videollamada para rezar por él y ahora también por la salud y seguridad de pacientes, enfermeros, doctores y todos quienes se arriesgan para luchar contra esta terrible enfermedad. <br /><br />Nuestro padre estuvo en una unidad de cuidados intensivos por 14 días, recibió el mejor cuidado en el Hospital Monte Sinaí de la ciudad de Nueva York y pudo ser incluido en un estudio clínico y recibir un tratamiento experimental de células madre. Aunque no sabremos si el tratamiento le ayudó en su recuperación sabemos que su fortaleza, ganas de luchar y vivir intensamente le permitió resistir, ser extubado y salir de la unidad de cuidados intensivos. <br /><br />El día 10 de Abril, después de estar hospitalizado por un total de 21 días nuestro padre fue dado de alta y regresó a casa.\\xa0<br /><br />Nuestro papá ahora descansa en casa junto con nuestra mamá y Paola, los doctores nos comunicaron que le espera una lenta recuperación por los próximos 6 a 8 meses hasta poder mejorar sus capacidades físicas nuevamente.\\xa0<br /><br />Durante el tiempo que él estuvo en el hospital, y así como miles de pequeños negocios, no pudimos acceder al paquete de estímulos impulsado por el gobierno de Estados Unidos para este tipo de empresas.\\xa0<br /><br />El negocio de mi padre en promedio de los últimos meses costó operar mensualmente\\xa0 $ 25,576.53\\xa0 que se distribuyen principalmente en el rol de pagos 69% (7 colaboradores), renta 14.5%\\xa0 y otras cuentas como servicios básicos, proveedores, línea de crédito, etc 16.5%.\\xa0<br /><br />Ninguno de estos rubros han sido pagados y el negocio al no ser considerado esencial no está dentro de los negocios programados para ser abiertos en el estado de New York\\xa0 según ha dicho el gobernador.\\xa0<br /><br /><br />Es por esta razón que estamos acudiendo a ustedes queridos amigos para apelar a su generosidad y poder recolectar la cantidad de $ 25,000 que ayude al negocio de nuestro padre y brinde alivio a las familias de sus colaboradores. <br /><br />El dinero que logremos recolectar de sus generosas donaciones será distribuido en la misma proporción de los costos de operar el negocio de nuestro padre. <br /><br />Muchas gracias por su amable atención y generocidad.<br /><br />\\xa0<br /><iframe media_type=\"0\" media_id=\"4Ul6_EJ3Swg\" class=\"youtube-replace\" title=\"YouTube video player\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px;width:560px;height:315px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4Ul6_EJ3Swg/?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"1\"></iframe>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><br /><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-patients-doctors-experiment-stem-cell-therapy-covid-19-mount-sinai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CBS News StemCell therapy</a>\\xa0\\n</p>',\n",

Through their hard work and positivity, <strong>Overtime is truly a place “where everybody knows your name”.</strong><br /><br /><img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53341232_1608141967457738_r.jpeg\" alt=\"53341232_1608141967457738_r.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" media_type=\"3\" /><br /><strong>-OUR EXPERIENCE WITH COVID-19</strong><br /><br />As a small business, <strong>COVID-19</strong> has presented Overtime with many <strong>challenges</strong>. Lori, Dan, and their incredible staff have <strong>done everything they needed to keep Overtime safe and open</strong>, including creating safety rules and measures that go <strong>beyond</strong> what is suggested and required by the CDC and local government. Overtime was able to <strong>receive some PPP loan money to keep its staff employed through the summer</strong> and <strong>make necessary safety renovations.</strong><br /><br />Even with the help of the PPP loan, L<strong>ori and Dan put all of the business’s reserves and their personal funds</strong> into helping Overtime become a safer place for the community, and to keep it afloat during the ever-changing rules for businesses. Overtime was even <strong>celebrated</strong> by a local news station <strong>for its many safety precautions and being a great place to gather</strong> to watch a game and <strong>still feel safe</strong>.\\xa0<br /><br /><strong>-UNEXPECTED EMERGENCIES</strong><br /><br />Even with careful precautions in place, Overtime, and the Prellbergs, <strong>have not been able to remain untouched</strong> by the pandemic.<br /><br /><strong>Lori is the heart and soul of Overtime,</strong> and you can find her working at least six days a week. Most days she is behind the bar herself welcoming everyone who walks through the door into her second-home. <strong>Her smile and positive attitude</strong> endear her to all who know her. Unfortunately, she has become very ill from this virus and has been in the hospital under <strong>intensive care for over a month</strong> in critical condition. It is impossible to predict how her body will continue to respond to this virus, but she is getting the best care possible. Everyone is praying for her recovery, but i<strong>t is still unsure what her future holds at this time</strong>. She means so much to the life and energy of Overtime and her absence has definitely been felt.<br />\\xa0<br /><img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53341232_1608142003160229_r.jpeg\" alt=\"53341232_1608142003160229_r.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" media_type=\"3\" /><br />As for her business and extended family, multiple staff members at Overtime also tested positive, and the <strong>business was closed for two weeks</strong> for staff recovery and deep-cleaning. We are blessed that our other staff members have since recovered from COVID-19, but this closure was <strong>in the middle of its busiest season</strong>.\\xa0 And by the time Overtime was ready to <strong>“re-open”,</strong> the <strong>government</strong> rolled out <strong>restrictions that prohibited dine-in service</strong>. Given the trajectory of COVID cases in Colorado and how long it was closed by the government over the summer, it seems unlikely that Overtime will be able to open for dine-in service until early February at the earliest. <strong>Being restricted from having dine-in service during NFL games, especially playoff season, is an unrecoverable situation for Overtime Sports Bar and Grill and it’s staff.\\xa0</strong><br /><br /><strong>Overtime’s dedicated staff,</strong> Lori and Dan’s extended family, <strong>have fought to keep Overtime safe and welcoming.</strong> They are now facing a <strong>hardship that affects their families during this chaotic time.</strong> For these hardworking, friendly, and supportive people, <strong>by the time Overtime can probably reopen for dine-in service,</strong> and re-open to full capacity, <strong>it will have been months of limited income.</strong><br /><br /><strong>-CALL FOR HELP</strong><br /><br />Like many others this year, the holiday season has become a challenging time for the Prellberg family and the business.<br /><br />If Lori pulls through her hospitalization,<strong> she will be unlikely to return to work anytime soon</strong>, as she goes through physical therapy to recover from the damage COVID has done to her lungs and body, and <strong>Dan</strong>, who also works at least six days a week, will likely have to spend significant time away from Overtime helping to <strong>care for the love of his life</strong>.\\xa0<br /><br />No one likes to ask for help, however <strong>Lori and Overtime need your help to keep the Prellberg family and Overtime afloat</strong> during Lori’s recovery for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lori and Dan have done everything in their power to help Overtime stay in business during the pandemic, including using their federal help, spending their personal savings, and using the limited savings of the business. Overtime is also <strong>looking into how to apply for the economic recovery money</strong> recently approved by the Colorado Legislature. <strong>But this money is not enough to keep the doors open. The recent shutdowns of the business, and the hospitalization of everyone’s second Mom have been the perfect storm for financial disaster. \\xa0</strong> <br /><br />\\xa0<strong>Please donate to help Lori and Overtime. Every amount helps.\\xa0</strong><br /><br /><img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53341232_1608140226596427_r.jpeg\" alt=\"53341232_1608140226596427_r.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" media_type=\"3\" /><br />Specifically, your gift will be used to help Overtime pay its rent, employees, utilities, and other business costs.<br /><br />Please know that no donation is too small and all are appreciated.\\xa0<br /><br />Whether you can or cannot donate, <strong>please consider sharing Lori and Overtime’s story with whomever you can.

       " '\\n<div>#SmallBusinessRelief<br /><br />Hello, my name is Ryan Key and I am a small business owner that provides affordable health care and coaching services to people looking to become healthier. My health coaching business was thriving before the COVID 19 pandemic. Ever since the shut down, my business started to lose money and suffer. I am a college-educated small business owner that provides affordable health coaching services to people looking to get healthier. In general, health coaching/personal training services get a poor reputation because a lot of trainers and coaches are incompetent and careless towards their clients. However, I put hours of research, effort and time into my craft. For personal training businesses, I was a Top Thumbtack Pro for 2017 and 2018. I would have been a Top Pro for 2019 and 2020 if there was not a pandemic. I am very highly rated on Thumbtack (4.99 rating) and Facebook (5 rating) with over 100 reviews and testimonials. I have worked with thousands of clients in the past and would love to expand my business for the future. Since people are avoiding public gyms due to COVID, most people enjoy the one-on-one coaching experience which gives my business a lot of potential for 2022.\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>If I were to receive funding, I would want to use the money to pay for on-going business expenses as well as gym equipment including a new treadmill, elliptical and a squat rack for my clients.\\xa0\\n</div>',\n",
       " '\\n<div>I am Natalia Herrera Sullivan. I am creating this fund because my grandfather Alfredo Azabache who is 98 is battling for his life in a hospital in Peru after contracting COVID. My grandpa was vaccinated and had his booster shot, but as an extremely active person at his age, he liked t be out of house. He got his first shot the same day I did, which tells you, at 97 he had to wait a lot, being in extreme quarantine was not doing him any good either. <br /><br />He has been a Small Business Owner all his life and to this day worked in his factory, this kept him lively, happy and healthy. He created a pool, billiard and fussbol table empire in Peru at a very young age and became a very recognized brand in Peru \"Fabrica Santa Beatriz\". His story has been covered several times given his amazing life and legacy as well as his smart and bright mind which built a business without no education. The Pandemic hit him hard as being active and working was his life. Many would say that he should not work at his age but he never let anyone tell him what to do. Work, vision and passion kept him going with a healthy lifestyle. However, as many of you know COVID is a tough virus and our sweet abuelito was not lucky enough to avoid it.\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>As a consequence of COVID, pneumonia compromised 30% of his lungs and after struggling with oxygen saturation levels variating, no stability was able to be reached and he was put in the ICU and tubed. ICU costs vary between $20K to $26K a week. All his kids and grandkids have come together to cover a bulk of expenses along with some money he saved but expenses continue to pile up as he fights the fight. Before going in the ICU he talked to me, he asked to see me and Leo, Leo\\'s name is Leo Alfredo after my grandpa and he has yet to meet him. Leo\\'s life has been pandemic so I have not been able to grant my grandpa that wish, but his lucidity to ask and point that out tells me he has much fight and life in him. Also, since as an elderly person his insurance only covers 30% of expenses, we are all faced with the situation of struggling for cash to deposit into the hospital. His business is barely surviving the pandemic as his main customers stopped buying, which given the nature of his business is something he expected.\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>My grandpa was always a rock of a man, never sick, healthy mind, dancer, funny, smart, always informed, and a patriarch in our family. If God\\'s will is to take him, we only hope it is one day surrounded by his family. After a full life with no diseases or underlying conditions, we are hoping that lack of money is not the factor that takes his life in suffering and alone and we are desperate to help him at this point. I don\\'t expect much, A dollar will make a difference if you have the possibility and find it in your heart to donate, if not please share amongst those who you think can help. Thank you and humbly sorry in advance that you have to come across this in your feed. This is very outside character for me, but my grandpa is so important to so many, I had to try.\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>Natalia\\xa0\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n</div>',\n",

Chuck is a strong, proud independent man that has faced great hardships throughout his lifetime, including the loss of his beloved wife, Jerri, to MS.  Even though his life was shattered by this tragic &amp; heartbreaking loss, Chuck managed to pull himself together &amp; restart his life in Nashville.  It was his and Jerri\\'s dream to someday move to Nashville from their home in Connecticut so that Chuck could pursue his dream of becoming a song writer.  He followed that dream and found his way to Nashville with little more than the clothes on his back.  But Chuck was determined to make it.  He scrapped together enough money &amp; resources to start his own window cleaning business all the while writing songs and performing around Nashville. Chuck is a gifted song writer and a terrific performer.  He is also a natural entrepreneur and established a website to promote undiscovered song writers like himself.  Since he hasn\\'t hit the big time with his songs yet, he diligently works throughout Nashville cleaning windows of businesses &amp; residences.  \\n</div>\\n<div>In early December, Chuck became very ill and was diagnosed with COVID19.  He spent 20 days in the hospital.  Like so many independent small business people, Chuck was hit hard during the economic shutdown, so his financial resources were drained; but he was climbing back on his ladders and returning to his performance venues when he was struck down by this wicked COVID virus.  Thankfully, Chuck has survived and is out of the hospital, but he has been unable to work at all for almost 1 month, so he is back down to barely more than what he came to Nashville with 8 years ago after he lost his wife.  I met Chuck 6 years ago and this man was a stranger but turned out to be a a savior and a dear trusted friend.  He is kind, humble and generous to everyone he meets.  He lives a very modest life in an apartment in East Nashville.  He has has a heart of gold and I know he has made such a positive impact on so many lives, including mine.  He is like a dear brother to me and I don\\'t know what I would do without him.  But now he is in a very tough financial situation due to his illness.  He has no relatives in this state and no one to help him recover &amp; get back on his feet.  I know there are many people that have suffered hardships due to this battle with COVID19, but I believe Chuck has suffered enough in his life. It\\'s time for the Angels to come to his aide now.  So, I am setting up this GoFundMe account in order to help Chuck heal &amp; get back on his divine path.  I am trying to raise just enough money to give him a month to recover &amp; build back his business.  Just $1000 will enable Chuck to keep his apartment, stay warm and have food to eat.  Please help me help this dear kind sweet soul recover his health &amp; his livelihood.  Thank you &amp; God Bless you for your support.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div> \\n</div><img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\" media_type=\"3\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62303649_1640937495935021_r.\" width=\"100%\" />\\n<div><br />\\n</div><img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\" media_type=\"3\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62303649_1640937537354033_r.\" width=\"100%\" />\\n<div><br />\\n</div><img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\" media_type=\"3\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62303649_1640937559386660_r.\" width=\"100%\" />\\n<div><br />\\n</div><img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\" media_type=\"3\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62303649_1640937593908037_r.\" width=\"100%\" />\\n<div><br />\\n</div>',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n<div>Hi, my name is Beth Schreiber and I am raising money for the Severson family. I am blessed to work with Maria at Stevensville Schools and call her my dear friend. Her husband Tony contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized on September 17th. There were no available beds or ambulances in Missoula, so an ambulance from Deer Lodge arrived and transported him to Butte. He has been battling ever since, away from his loved ones, amidst a few set backs, several medical interventions, and no clear release date. Tony is a wonderful family man; father to two grown boys, a daughter in law, and a new grandfather of a beautiful baby girl. Many know him as the Kwik Dry Carpet Cleaning guy, and he's the first one many call when they need a hand, an ear, or a good laugh. As a small business owner Tony has not been able to work through this illness or collect an income, the end is not yet in sight, and the day to day expenses are too much for Maria to handle on just her own public school salary. They will further need to meet their high deductible before insurance will kick in to cover any expenses. Many in the world have been deeply affected by this pandemic and feel helpless to do anything about it. If you fit in that category as I do, here's a brilliant opportunity to help. Any little bit could go a long way, and please forward along to as many others as you are willing. Blessings to you all and may you and yours stay safe and healthy in this difficult time.\\n\\n</div>\",\n",

One such family, David and Mona (Claudia) Flores, have hit a major road bump in the past few weeks when David and Mona contracted CoVid. As many of you may already know, David in still in the hospital, while Mona and the boys are at home in quarantine. Mona's symptoms are still freighting, but she does not require hospitalization, and by God's grace, the boys are doing well. David is making good progress, but will have a long road to recovery and will need extensive physical therapy to get back to being able to work. David's treatment is not fully covered by insurance and they've already exhausted their savings. Meanwhile, both David's painting business and Mona's bakery remain closed while bills continue to pile up. As we continue to pray for their health, we would also like to help them out financially. They have applied for every type of financial assistance, but the system seems to be working against small business and they are not able to keep up. If you can help financially in any way, I know they would be most grateful. There are more details we are leaving out, but just know that every dime would go to keep them afloat until they can get back to work.

       " '\\n<p>I am raising money to help our wonderful friends Scott and Karen as they try to recover from the covid 19 virus . They have not been able to work and have incurred many medical expenses and (bills continue to pile up ) as a result of this terrible illness . Karen is still very sick . Please help us to ease a little of the financial burden as they try to heal. This is a very difficult time for them and we can show them as much love and support as possible . I set the goal high , but anything you can give will help. Thank you all so much !<br /><br />Please read the post that Karen wrote on her page .\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>IT’S NOT ABOUT YOU.... But it is. I don’t understand why so many of my friends &amp; family are living their best lives not wearing masks ALWAYS and staying 10’+ feet away from people not in their households. I’m so beyond anger &amp; without comprehension at the lack of thought to the danger these daily decisions cause every human. I stayed home &amp; didn’t do shit for over a year because I did NOT want Covid. I got Covid, an ambulance ride, a stay in the hospital for my 50th birthday, weeks of financially crushing lost wages for both of us &amp; what will be untold medical bills. No, we didn’t even get to the long term fallout which is what I fear most. Can I tell you how terrifying it is to not know what’s going on &amp; why you are getting X-rays, CT scans with contrast, blood thinner injections in your stomach, the fire of steroids being injected into you, what it is to only be able to sleep face down because you don’t want more lung damage, the fear of will you be one of the cases that goes very badly or that you’ll have a stroke? Because at 49, up to running 22miles, zero medical conditions, zero meds, 21% BMI.... why am I here? My crime was laughing with &amp; holding my husband who is in healthcare. He brought Covid home from his clinic. We are not ok. This is not ok. This didn’t have to happen. While I was receiving care, I put the lives of every person I came near &amp; their family in danger. My last nurse’s sister died from undiagnosed breast cancer because she couldn’t get treatment on time. She died of Covid at 42 w/ 4kids (youngest 3yrs old) 3wks ago. Her death certificate won’t say Covid even though from beginning to end, that’s what killed her. So, when you are running side by side with your group, heading out to gyms &amp; theme parks, eating in restaurants at tables full of people outside of your household, attending live races which are a joke &amp; not safe, are having play dates for your kids without masks, taking side by side pictures with friends… You did this. You are the problem. That is the hard truth you MUST know. This isn’t going away until every one of you adheres to distance &amp; masks until enough people can be vaccinated assuming the strains don’t continue to mutate faster than vaccine pace. In short, be a Toughie, suck it up, &amp; act not for your wants, but for what your country needs. Maybe seeing the fallout in me, someone I assume you love &amp; care about will help to make it all less abstract. Please start to see yourself as the larger picture. What you do matters greatly. Love one another with your choices &amp; actions. I can’t tell you how bad this is. It’s not going away quickly &amp; I am beyond angry as I sacrificed while you played. I am covered in rash, having allergic reactions, need a chart to manage the medicine chest I must take. This should not have happened. To be clear, I don’t want your thoughts &amp; prayers.

       " '\\n<p>Like many, Covid-19 has severely impacted my small business. 90% of my sales are made at live events, pop-up and vendor markets. As a result of the lockdown I went 7 months without being able to attend a market. While I tried for weeks to be approved for unemployment, I was deemed ineligible for any type of assistance, including food stamps. I also stopped receiving child support from my first husband during this time, which put an even bigger hole in my finances.\\xa0<br /><br />This put quite a heavy burden on me, one that sadly, I have not been able to carry on my own,despite my best efforts at working 3 side jobs, and continuing to look for full time employment(I have applied for over 200 jobs since January!) I have been unable to make ends meet.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>At this point I am dealing with shut off notices for my utilities, as well as repossession of my vehicle, which is mere months from being paid off.\\xa0<br /><br />I am devastated, ashamed, and humbly asking for help, as I have exhausted my efforts, and atthis point I won’t make it to the other side of this without some help.\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Those that know me personally know that I am usually the first one in line to offer a helping hand, and not so good at reaching out for help for myself. I have tried promotions and flash sales to increase my business income, online vendor markets, and have even begun doing in person events again, but the hole was already so great, that these efforts have been almost meaningless.\\xa0\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>I am asking for help, whether through donations or even purchases of my hand crafted products.

If any of you have ordered her scrumptious cheesecakes, eaten any of her mouth watering smoked brisket, or any of her other amazing baked goods and delicious foods, you know how talented and impressive this young lady is. If you’ve visited her café and bakery in Janesville, been treated by your business to one of her catered meals or had the pleasure of being able to grab her delightful treats at the Janesville Farmers Market before they were sold out, you know how much love goes into her life’s dream of baking and cooking.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Taryn runs Taryn’s Tempting Treats with the help of her veteran husband, Michael, who did 3 tours serving our Country. They do ALL of this by themselves.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>They have 2 small children – Ava and MJ – who have this Auntie Audra wrapped around my heart.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Taryn’s Tempting Treats is this family’s main source of income and is in jeopardy of closing if they don’t get the urgent financial help they so desperately need.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Last week on Monday, November 22, both Taryn and Michael were diagnosed with Covid 19. Taryn was hospitalized and then was able to be monitored at home. Her oxygen levels were very low and are still being monitored. She has been extremely sick and unable to much of anything. Her fever finally broke, but she still has a long road to recovery.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Michael was hospitalized the same day and is still in the hospital. His oxygen levels have been even worse than Taryn’s and we’re still praying he will not have to be put on a ventilator. He also had several blood clots in his lungs. They have been administering blood thinners to break them down so that they do not travel to his heart or brain. We are praying that he will be able to come home this week, but he also has a long road to recovery.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>They had to close down Taryn’s Tempting Treats indefinitely. They also had to cancel the 200 plus Thanksgiving orders and may not be able to do any Christmas orders, which accounts for a bulk of the business income for the year.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Taryn does not have any health insurance due to being a small business owner and the high cost of insurance. Michael has insurance on himself through the VA, but it is unknown at this time how much of the hospitalization, tests, procedures, medications, etc. that the VA will cover.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Taryn and Michael are in desperate need of financial relief at this time as well as continued prayers for a full recovery and help with their children once Michael is released from the hospital (praying he will be) and the family can be out of isolation.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>So, we’re asking you to help this incredible family to ease their financial burdens as they continue to heal and hopefully return to and open up the business in the near future. They have both given so much to so many others and have worked tirelessly building Taryn’s Tempting Treats as they raise their two wonderful children – Ava and MJ.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Any support that you could give at this extremely difficult time would be much appreciated. Prayers, financial support for medical care, household expenses, and business expenses, as well as continued understanding of unfulfilled orders that many folks were counting on are desperately needed.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Please consider supporting this family and the business during this crucial time. All the proceeds will go directly to Taryn and Michael. If you feel uncomfortable giving through this venue, please message me and I will give you information on where to send checks, use PayPal, or Venmo.\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>Again – any support is SO greatly appreciated! I love this family with all my heart, and it’s been a heartbreaking week to see what they are enduring. Praying for healing, strength, peace and financial burdens to be lifted. Thank you all so much!\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>From the bottom of our hearts, we also humbly ask that you share this link with friends and family and, if possible, in giving (any amount will help).\\n</div>\\n<div><br />\\n</div>\\n<div>We thank you for your support and God bless each and every one of you!!\\n</div>',\n",

       " '\\n\\n<div>Hello,\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div>A few clients have come together to create a GoFundMe to help Beach Dog with the expenses they have accrued and keep accruing due to the 2-year battle with the city of Delray Beach. Opening a new business during the peak of COVID was hard enough to say the least for owner Jennifer Roselli. However, they have survived, and Jen has created a beautiful business. Beach Dog offers a fun and SAFE place for our fur babies. Due to the fact the city of Delray Beach changed its zoning regulations Beach Dog is in violation with the city. However, there are two other local businesses that offer the same exact services that Beach Dog does, respectively 2 miles north and west that are classified with the same zoning; Barkingham Palace &amp; Pet Smart. They are not being hit with violations from the city or animal control like Beach Dog is consistently. This is discriminatory and a lawsuit waiting to happen with the city. Her attorney has been told that they have been “grandfathered” in, but the city does not have any documentation of that. After a long extensive process and hearing from the community to support pet hotels the city did recently change the ordinance to allow pet hotels in the GC zoning district as a conditional use. The conditional use process is very extensive and expensive.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div>Beach Dog has not only cleaned up the immediate area from local drug users that lived behind the property; but has also employed a staff of 10. Within 2 years, during the pandemic and economic downturn, Beach Dog has become a staple in Delray. They foster for local rescue groups and are signed up to board dogs for military people who are deployed at no cost. Giving back to the community is deeply rooted in Jennifer Roselli. They are also considered essential as many of their clients are doctors, nurses and EMTs. During COVID, clients needed a safe place for their dogs while they were working tirelessly to save people’s lives. Beach Dog was highlighted in the Palm Beach Post because Jen took in a dog for over a month, at no charge, while one of her clients, Glenn Kaufman, fought for his life on a ventilator due to COVID. There was no place for his dog to go and Beach Dog willingly stepped up.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div>\\xa0\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div>Jen has done everything the City of Delray has asked but it has been to no avail. For the City to go after a local, woman owned, small business during a pandemic, that many clients consider as essential, is not a good reflection on Delray Beach. Delray is a growing community, and a growing community for our four-legged friends that need a safe place to go. The city of Delray Beach and animal control has hit her with violation after violation. She is still being hit with violation after violation even with the recent ordinance change until the conditional use has been approved. The mounting attorney’s fees, improvements made to BD making the West wall and doors soundproof, having to hire a zoning specialist and architect to take on the conditional use process and the fines Beach Dog is being hit with is making it challenging for any business to survive. The city of Delray Beach is threatening $30,000 in fines a month until she gets approved for the conditional use which can take 4-6 months. This is detrimental to any small business. The proposed improvements Beach Dog will have to do to get approved for the\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div>conditional use is extensive and expensive. The entire building needs to be sound proofed on top of what she has already done. I am asking for the help of the clients and community to help raise money for the expenses she has already incurred and continues to incur while trying to rectify the zoning situation with the city. So far, she has incurred 50k in expenses. Let’s ban together to help Beach Dog.

Ron was diagnosed with COVID 19 and placed in the ICU in a medically induced coma, medically paralyzed and on life support. He had an emergency surgery the first night that the surgeon had told our parents that Ron probably wouldn't survive.... but to everyone's amazement, he did!  Ron, over the course of the next couple of weeks,  managed to beat COVID 19, while on life support including a ventilator and feeding tube, 2 infections, pneumonia, dialysis, and paralysis. Ron has lost 66 pounds in those 2 months most of which was muscle. \\n</div>\\n<div>Ron was released to a Physical Rehabilitation facility on September 4th, 2021 where he continued his fight. It took 7 weeks but he was finally able to come off of all the machines and tubes.  Ron is still trying to regain his mobility.

He will most likely not be able to get back to work any time soon even though he wants to and is trying his best to get his life back. \\n</div>\\n<div>Ron and I come from a family of veterans.

Nimitz before being honorably discharged. \\n</div>\\n<div>After going through a divorce, Ron was a single father. The courts granted him full custody of his one year old daughter, who he raised completely on his own. She is now an adult with a family of her own making Ron a grandpa of 3 including twin boys. \\n</div>\\n<div>Ron is a 5 year member of the Riders For Life Riding Club, 3 years of which he has been an active patch member. The Riders For Life Riding Club are known for their charitable toy drives for the needy at Christmas, charity rides and as motorcycle escorts at funerals for anyone who asks. \\n</div>\\n<div>Ron also owns a small, local plumbing company but due to the effects of COVID 19, he is unable to run it. Can you please help Ron?

       " '  Hi! My name is Shayna. I am Miranda\\'s younger sister.          As many of you know, Miranda was hospitalized with Covid on November 20th.          Her symptoms started out as a regular cold virus with some sore throat and body aches. She was starting to feel slightly better, when she took a turn and decided to get tested. After testing positive 12 days ago, she took a turn for the worse.          She had stopped responding to my text and calls and even forgot it was my daughter\\'s birthday (Which it you know how much Miranda loves Evie, she is ALWAYS the first to message \"Happy Birthday\") and I knew something was wrong!) It turns out that she had gotten much worse since the previous night. She could not walk unassisted and was having very labored breathing.         Within a few hours she was admitted to the hospital in Ely and her oxygen levels were at 70%! Her doctor told her that she probably would have died at home the following day had she not found the courage and strength to go in.          She is now home from the hospital with an oxygen tank and pulse oximeter in tow everywhere she goes. They do not know how long  her lungs will need to rely on the constant flow of oxygen.          The past 18 months have been very hard on Miranda\\'s family.  Being diagnosed with Mast Cell disease last year,  they are on the constant lookout for her body to go into anaphylaxis (which it frequently does) and have taken up many more medical bills piling on for specialist visits and multiple special antihistamine medications daily. With the added stressors of mounting Covid medical bills, her husband missing so much work, and the Holidays approaching, I know she could use your help!          She has another chest X-Ray in a week or so. Please send prayers that the meds are clearing up her lungs and she continues to have improvement! This is SUCH a scary virus that almost took my sissy away. We have no idea what the lasting damage will be, so PLEASE keep the Kainz family in your prayers   ',\n",

       " '  In Honor of the Castellanos Family Due to the Loss of their Loved One, Mario Castellanos         It is with much sadness that we are fundraising on behalf of the Castellanos Family due to the loss of their loved one, Mario Castellanos.    Mario was a Son, a Brother, a Husband to his beautiful wife Christina and Father of their two darling little boys Mariano (9) and Alexander (3).  To say that he will be greatly missed by all who loved him is an absolute understatement.    Mario had battled cancer 8 years ago and was recently hospitalized in the ICU for over a month due to Covid19.  Regretfully, his condition continued to worsen over time as he had been placed on a ventilator and later induced into a coma.  Due to the damage to his lungs from his previous battle with cancer, he just couldn’t continue to fight anymore.    As you can imagine, his Family is absolutely devastated and although we cannot relieve them of this pain, we would like to help them to find peace in knowing that we are here for them and we care.  At this time, we are asking for donations to help to ease the Family of some of the financial strain incurred with the unexpected medical and funeral expenses.    Thank you so very much for your consideration as any amount donated or even a simple share would mean so very much! Be blessed!    ',\n",
       " '  My name is Trista Taylor,  the daughter of Kellie Hardman, who I am holding this fundraiser for. My mom Kellie got Covid about two weeks ago. Thursday afternoon she was picked up by an ambulance and hospitalized. She was diagnosed with Covid Pneumonia, and another infection in her body. They released her with an oxygen tank later that night.     The next day she was picked up by a fire truck as an ambulance cannot get down the ranch road. She was transferred into an ambulance and driven to the hospital in Show Low, where she was later flown to Flagstaff. Her levels were looking good and she was starting to feel a little better when she got up to use the restroom with help of a nurse and her blood oxygen levels dropped to 69%. She has now been put on a Ventilator, Medically Induced Coma, Medically Induced paralyzation, and they have no update as of now when she will be awake and off the ventilator.    I know she will come out on top with some prayers and love sent her way. We are unable to go up to her room and see her so all we can do is pray, stay positive, and send the most amount of love possible.         Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to help my family in this time of need.  ',\n",
       " '     Hello friends, family and community,\\xa0  “Chances are if you have stepped within 5ft of Zeppelin Station, you probably have been greeted by, chatted with or laughed along side this man”. \\xa0           Those were the words I was honored to write before parting ways with Zeppelin back in November and now I am sad to report that this same man is in the hospital and needs our help.\\xa0           Shortly after the state regulations changed and the mask mandate was lifted, Earl Sutton contacted COVID 19 and was immediately hospitalized at Aurora Health for extreme health conditions. When first tested his oxygen levels were at 35% and his heart rate had gone up, triggering a life long battle with diabetes. On Sunday June 6th, Earl suffered a stroke while hospitalized and doctors found a blood clot in his brain. They were able to transfer him to Swedish Medical where an immediate surgery took place, relieving the clot. Since then Earl has been in a medically induced coma, while doctors wait for his body to heal. As of Tuesday morning they have reduced the amount of oxygen they are giving him (good sign) and he is stable, however Earl is still in a coma and still has a long way to go.\\xa0  I am keeping in close contact with his twin brother Floyd Sutton who just recently suffered a head on collision from a drunk driver, also dealing with medical bills of his own. He is updating me daily with Earls condition but of course is extremely concerned about the amount of money it will take to not only keep Earl in the hospital (since Saturday now) but ongoing expenses that come with recovery. Earl has not had health insurance for quite some time and is missing paychecks as the days go on. I am hoping to offer some sort of financial relief as things get harder and harder onhim and his family.\\xa0           Earl is one of the kindest, sweetest and most caring people I have ever met. He would give his left arm for the people he loves and I only hope we can pay his kind soul back for all the warmth he has given us. As a twins, Floyd is not only responsible for his brothers well being but feels all the pain that Earl is going through, as if it were his own. Please share and donate what you can. Every dollar helps. ❤️     ',\n",

       " \"When it rains it pours, and this year seems to be quite the storm for our family. As many of you may know, my mom, Jan Neumann, contracted pneumonia and COVID back in April. She has had quite the battle since and is continuing to fight daily towards her recovery. She began by being hospitalized on April 24th where she was placed in quarantine and unable to see or touch any of her family or friends. Going through the first two weeks of her treatment alone, scared, depressed, and losing hope of ever getting better, her health quickly took a turn for the worse. She\\xa0 developed clots in her legs which turned into a pulmonary embolism, had a severe rupture of her Rectus Sheath causing severe internal bleeding, developed a severe GI blockage, and her Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome progressed into Pulmonary Fibrosis making her breathing so weak and difficult that she was eventually placed on a ventilator and feeding tube and transferred over to the Good Samaritan ICU in Corvallis to continue her care.\\xa0  Her team of providers were hopeful, but also very honest and real about the severity of her condition and the statistics of her recovering not being in her favor. We continued to take her recovery one day as it came and received continuous prayer and support from so many. Within 7 days of being placed on the ventilator, she was able to breathe on her own with oxygen assistance and was able to have the ventilator removed. About one week later she was stable enough to be transferred to her current treatment facility for long term physical/occupational therapy to regain her strength and learn to walk again after being in a hospital bed for so long and having severe muscular atrophy.\\xa0  I cannot begin to imagine what my mom has been through, the majority of it alone due to COVID restrictions and protocols within each facility. As the hospital bills have already began to roll in, the cost of her treatment so far is over 500K before insurance coverage. Obviously not being able to work during this time or in the near future, her and my dad have lost the income she once brought in. Added stress is the last thing she needs during her recovery, especially financial stress. We are hopeful that insurance covers a large portion of the medical bills, but that remains to be seen.\\xa0  My mom is the person who never asks for anything, yet gives everything to those she loves. It is our time to help this amazing and truly selfless person during her time of need. We understand not everyone can donate monetarily, but anything you are able to do to support her throughout this is so appreciated. Meals, prayer, advice, your time, sharing this GoFundMe, etc...  Our family cannot thank everyone enough for all the love and support you have given to us during Andy's fight against cancer and now my mom's continued recovery from COVID. We are so grateful to be blessed with the incredible individuals in our lives and know we wouldn't be here without you.\",\n",

       " \"  To say 2020-2021 has been a horrible year is an understatement. I’ve always found it morally reprehensible to compare personal struggles. We all have our own issues so I feel awkward setting up this GoFundMe as I have nowhere else to return.     \\xa0     My mother had COPD so I knew she was at high-risk to develop Covid. She raised me mostly on her own as a single mother in a rather rural town in South Dakota. The mentality towards Covid was more lax as neighbors are sprawled over acres of land. She was not particularly concerned about the pandemic. Maybe it’s true but maybe it isn’t. All I know is that she developed Covid in November and was hospitalized for almost two months. In that year total she spent six months in the hospital. She died December 28, 2020, just two weeks before her birthday. She would have been 54.      ***I also want add that the vaccine hadn't come out yet. not anti-vaxxers. There was literally no vaccine. She was desperate for one. But even with her condition, vaccines of any brand, be it J&amp;J, Moderna, and Pfizer dont have huge stocks in small midwestern towns. \\xa0     After returning to NYU in the spring, my grades tanked. When I returned this fall, I lost my academic scholarship because of my abysmal GPA from the previous semester. NYU is not a need-blind school and even the most extenuating of circumstances are not taken into consideration. Not only did I lose my scholarship, I also lost my work-study program. Perversely, because of my mother’s life insurance payment, our family assets were too high to qualify for financial aid this fall semester.     \\xa0     Life insurance is society’s strange way of offering condolences, but it is not the windfall people expect it to be. What did my step-father, brother, and I spend the life insurance on? A funeral, overpriced counseling, paying off medical bills from the four months earlier in 2020 when she had been hospitalized for four months...\\xa0 It wasn't enough and we had to re-mortgage our home. Previously, we had all been on my mother’s insurance. but a month ago, we received a crazy bill in the mail. For most of the pandemic, private insurance companies covered the cost of 90% of covid hospitalization, but that changed in the past three months. Now these insurance companies are charging many families like mine for treatment.     \\xa0     Someone asked me why I don't, after all this tragedy, I transfer out of NYU and attend state school in South Dakota and I want to repond here, because it is a question that deserves an answer.     \\xa0     I am a gay woman. Everyday in high school, I was called a faggot. I sat in the library eating lunch, alone, everyday for four years. I am continuing my education in New York City not out of choice, but necessity. My step-father has only recently started to accept my sexuality but I am still shunned in my hometown. Even at my mother’s wake, I heard a whisper: “there’s the dyke.”     \\xa0     So I am asking for $60,000. Approximately $31,000 will cover the rest of the cost of the medical bills. $5,000 will help pay for my rent and textbooks, and the rest will help re-pay the mortgage on our family home, which we are now several months behind on.       I do hate accepting charity but I’m just not sure what to do. My friend recommended I start this GoFundMe page. Anything helps, really, even if we don’t reach $60,000. I want to properly mourn and heal from the death of my mother without constantly feeling anxious about my family’s financial situation. But I just can’t do it alone anymore.     \\xa0     Thank you for reading this.     ~Laurie     \",\n",

I love doing God\\'s work by providing empathic, compassionate care to those suffering with anxiety, depression, panic attacks, phobias, mood disorders, abuse, and trauma.       \\xa0       \\xa0       On October 13th, my father passed away unexpectedly. We had been planning to move to Ohio from Washington State to be closer to him while he battled a rare form of blood cancer. We left for Ohio the next day.       \\xa0       \\xa0       On 10/18, my husband and I developed covid symptoms. We arrived in Ohio on 10/19 and I was unable to view my dad\\'s body before he was cremated, because I was sick. My symptoms worsened and on 10/29, my husband called 9-1-1 because I couldn\\'t stop coughing, could not breathe or catch my breath and had trouble walking.       \\xa0       \\xa0       I was admitted into the ER and diagnosed with COVID-19 and Respiratory Failure with Hypoxia. I received horrible treatment in the ER. I was mocked, laughed at, and ridiculed by the nurses and nurse practitioner, who told me, \"You may never go home. You may die here.\"       \\xa0       \\xa0       The room was filthy with trash on the floor, I was not offered food or water; or told that I couldn\\'t eat because of my condition. I was not given pillows or blankets, despite asking twice. My husband had to retrieve these items from the nurse\\'s station. I was not allowed outside the room, because I had covid, but I had been sick for 11 days and one is only considered contagious for 10 days after symptoms start. I should not have been considered contagious.       \\xa0       \\xa0       I had been in my room for 9 hours. No one asked if I needed to use the restroom. My violent coughing made me incontinent and I soiled myself and the bed. Eventually, my husband asked for a solution and I was brought a mobile commode.       \\xa0       \\xa0       Once admitted into the hospital, the nurses were kind and attentive. They were my angels after my horrific ordeal. I improved against all odds. On Monday 11/1, I was told, \"If you can refrain from using oxygen and your O2 saturation stays in healthy range, you can go home tomorrow.\" I stopped the oxygen, was evaluated by the respiratory team, and sent home with an oxygen tank.       \\xa0       \\xa0       I was discharged and given instructions to take dexymethasone, once per day with food and water for 7 days. I finished my meds on 11/8. One week later, I started acting strange and my mother and husband were very concerned about me. I had developed Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder. My mom found articles from medical journals detailing the risks of not tapering off corticosteroids, like dexymethasone. Adding insult to injury, all that needed to happen was to have the doctor instruct me to simply cut the pills in half the last 4 days. Sadly, this did not happen.       \\xa0       \\xa0       Thankfully, my hypomanic episode ended after 5 days. But the damage was done. I spent our rent money, and our car payment money, I overdrafted our checking account by $1000, and maxed out nearly all of our credit cards on expensive, impulsive purchases. Worst of all, I saw my clients. I will never forget the looks of horror and worry on their faces. Had I known I was hypomanic, I would not have seen them. I ruined 5 long-term therapeutic relationships and referred the clients to competent therapists.       \\xa0       \\xa0       I had already taken a leave of absence and was without income for 6 weeks. Now, I was losing even more money. My husband had to stay home to care for me, to watch me, to ensure I wasn\\'t going to burn the house down, or harm myself, or try to drive my car.       \\xa0       \\xa0       Our church elders and leadership committee in Washington is meeting on Monday 11/29 to discuss how they may be able to help us. They may be able to pay our rent and car payments for December and January. We are so blessed if this comes to pass.       \\xa0       \\xa0       But I still have the hospital bills. I was uninsured when I was hospitalized. My ER visit is $10,844.32 and my hospital stay is $18,297.95, for a grand total of $29,142.27 (photo documentation attached). The hospital billing department will give me a 25% discount ($7285.57) if I can pay the bill in its entirety by February 20, 2021. Thus, I need to humble myself before the Internet and beseech my family, friends, and complete strangers to help me pay my $21,856.70 hospital bill.       \\xa0       \\xa0       I kindly ask you to consider helping me in my endeavor if you are moved to do so. Or, alternatively, I ask that you share the link to this page. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your consideration. May God Bless You.       \\xa0       \\xa0     img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61494901_1637897190987840_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61494901_1637897205231240_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61494901_1637897220601080_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61494901_1637897256342132_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61494901_1637897273366597_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0   ',\n",
       " \"  Hi, my name is Sabrea and I have a very close family friend that has been battling Covid Pneumonia. And although this person and their family would like to remain anonymous, I know that they have a long road of recovery ahead of them . This beloved friend has been hospitalized for some time due to respiratory complications and remains in the ICU. This person is a valued friend and God's servant in their community, and although they have spent countless hours caring for others, we now need to turn our focus to caring for them. Currently, they will need to live in a rehab facility upon leaving the hospital due to weakness and currently on a ventilator.  Their family fears that there will not be enough resources for them to live in a facility and heal as the cost of a rehab center is quite high, even with insurance. If you are able to donate even a small amount, this will help them ensure their current home and utilities remain on and that they can focus on healing in rehab.          I will be updating their health status as the family allows, for those who would like to follow their recovery journey.   \",\n",
       " '  Hello, I\\'m Adriana, &amp; this is my mom Rebecca\\'s story of her fight against COVID.    As the world continues to battle with COVID &amp; its lasting effects on us all &amp; on our daily life, my mother Rebecca had an up-close &amp; personal battle with it that she\\'s so lucky to have made it out of. As a result, my brothers, along with the rest of our family, &amp; I got to know \\'\\'COVID\\'\\' on a personal level as well &amp; go through/see the damaging effects and marks it leaves on the ones we love and us. COVID has forever changed our family, the way it has the world.         September 28th, 2021, my mother Rebecca was admitted into Shannon hospital with an oxygen level of 40% &amp; entirely out of it, not even able to walk on her own into the hospital. We had no knowledge of what she was battling internally &amp; neither did she; what we \\'\\'thought\\'\\' was a simple cold/sinus infection days before turned out to be COVID pneumonia (delta variant) &amp; would forever change our lives. There were no major signs or symptoms within her that indicated she wasn\\'t producing enough oxygen, let alone having trouble breathing on her own.    Within 48 hours of being admitted, she was placed in the ICU on a ventilator, in a medically induced coma, medically paralyzed, fighting for her life. Our rollercoaster began &amp; most days felt like it wouldn\\'t ever stop or get better. Every day was a struggle, with COVID, you cant go day by day; you have to take it hour by hour; that\\'s how quick this virus is.. after a week and a half of my mom being in ICU on the ventilator, the doctors had reached out &amp; told us that she has a 1% chance at life &amp; wouldn\\'t even give her but maybe six more days of life left before having to take her off the ventilator &amp; for my brothers &amp; I to start making funeral arrangements.    That wasn\\'t an option for us, &amp; we kept our faith and gained the strength to let my mom run her course through this virus; it wasn\\'t her time to leave us or this earth, and we weren\\'t going to let her! My brothers &amp; I had only 30 minutes a day, a walkie-talkie &amp; being on the outside of the glass door as a form of our communication while my mom was in COVID ICU.    After many days of ups and downs, good and bad, after four failed attempts at a tracheostomy, and four heart stops/pauses later, my mother was able to get a tracheostomy placed which then allowed them to begin to wake my mother up and take her off the paralytic &amp; out of a coma. For the first time in 69 days, I got to see my mother with her eyes open. The coma, along with paralytic and no movement for over two months, took a major toll on her, mainly in her hands, she is limited in her mobility in hands at the moment, thanks be to God she is walking &amp; there was no brain damage due to the lack of oxygen. We received the best Christmas present ever and got to bring my mom home on December 24th, 2021! Although she is still on oxygen while at home and still suffers from getting acquainted with everyday life, she perseveres and tries to improve daily, but it\\'s hard for her to get back to normal without proper Rehab. My mother used to be so independent, and now she\\'s been dependent on others, and that\\'s taken a toll emotionally; we are doing this GoFundMe to raise money for proper rehab for my mom, so she can get back to many of the things she loved most (taking care of her grandkids, driving, cooking, and even something as simple as going into a store &amp; to also raise awareness on how severe COVID can be and the long term effects it leaves on those who are hospitalized with COVID &amp; the families &amp; friends that love &amp; care for them. The funds raised will allow her to go into Encompass Rehab here, who, unfortunately, at the time of release, was not accepting her insurance or any charity cases.. Please continue sending lots of prayers &amp; good vibes my mom\\'s way as she has a long road of recovery, but Thanks be to God, he made her a mircale and she is still here, and for that we are forever blessed.         Thank you for your time &amp; for the many, many family &amp; friends who helped us while my mom was hospitalized &amp; while at home; we couldn\\'t do it without or amazing support system!             img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62072169_1644411497713577_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62072169_1644411512382889_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62072169_1644411525751317_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62072169_1644411548849503_r.\"   /                       Adriana, Sergio &amp; Diego Pomar  ',\n",
       " \"  Hi my name is Ivan and I am fundraising as a last resort to help my family get through my COVID recovery.  My COVID story begins back in April of 2020 when I was furloughed due to COVID cutbacks from my job. \\xa0As one that bounces back I was able to find new employment 90 days later. \\xa0That however, was short lived as in May of 2021 I was once again furloughed for reasons related to COVID. \\xa0From that point on I remained unemployed until August of 2021 when I found a new job.  19 days into my new position my family was quarantined due to COVID exposure, within a couple of days my wife tested positive and the virus swept through my family very quickly. \\xa0I was not spared and I was the one who got it the worse. \\xa0By August 28th I was already 4 days into a 104 degrees fever that would not break and I had lost my sense of smell and taste. \\xa0That night I was hospitalized with a SO2 rating of 60. \\xa0According to my family those first few days/weeks were the worst as doctors kept explaining how every night would be my last night and permanent brain injury was nearly certain. \\xa0I however, made through those darkest hours but not without paying the price of being hospitalized for 2 months, intubated and on a respirator.  I have been told I am a miracle recovery as I recovered from COVID, pneumonia and a collapsed lung. Doctors say I am one of the few to leave the hospital after being admitted for so long and being as badly ravished as I was.  Now starts the real challenge in my opinion. I am currently unable to work for the foreseeable future, fortunately I may have a job to return to when I can return to work, but by my best estimates that is still 3-4 months away. In the meantime, my family and I are surviving on my wife's salary which does not cover our current expenses let alone our increasing medical bills.  Despite my efforts to liquidate assets we have in and around the home it is not proving to be near enough to sustain the most basic and necessary lifestyles. Unfortunately there is no aid for COVID survivors, unless I fall into a specialty group funded by larger organizations. I fall under the category of hard working provider that can no longer provide for his family.  So I turn to you, the public to help me get through these difficult few months in order for me to stay in my home of 8 years. As I mentioned this is a last resort, and not something I take likely as I feel it is no ones responsibility but my own to support my family. However, I also realize there comes a time when circumstances go beyond even what is possible for me and help is needed.  Therefore thank you for your generosity,\\xa0 fortunately I grow stronger everyday and look forward to my full recovery.  God Bless  \\xa0  \\xa0  \",\n",
       " \"  Early September, both of our parents began feeling sick with Pneumonia like symptoms.  As time passed, their health worsened.  Our father went to Urgent Care and was prescribed antibiotics.  This simmered his symptoms a bit but after a week he was severely malnourished, shaking, coughing profusely, and lost a tremendous amount of weight.  On 9/15, both of our parents were diagnosed and hospitalized with severe Covid-Pneumonia...              DAD:  Lost over 30 lbs in under 2 weeks.  Although he was breathing on his own, he was still gasping for air.  Doctors gathered blood work, took x-rays and ordered a CT scan because they discovered blood clots in his legs.  Fortunately his oxygen levels were excellent at 99% but he was incredibly weak and short of breath with any kind of movement or activity such as walking or using the bathroom.  Overall he is recovering at a steady pace.  However he’s developed a rash during his hospitalization which appeared on his legs and has now spread over half of his body.  Dad’s been given a blood thinner to help with the blood clots and a cream to relieve the itchy skin rash.  He’s regained some of his strength and his cough has dissipated.  Thankfully, Dad was discharged after 5 days.              MOM:  We found her in bed with labored breathing, she was incoherent and unresponsive.  911 was called and she was transported to the hospital.  She was originally admitted to IMCU but was transferred to ICU the next day for closer observation.  She was struggling to breathe on her own and placed on BiPAP, an oxygen machine which she was strongly dependent, and one step from using a ventilator.  She couldn't be off oxygen long enough to drink or eat, this went on for 5 days.  She rapidly lost 40 lbs and was fighting for her life.  We were on the phone with nurses and doctors every day, afternoon and every evening.          Mom has underlining health conditions:  She's had cancer several times (uterus, gallbladder, colon, and kidney), she now has only one kidney with stage 2 kidney failure.  She has chronic Fibromyalgia, chronic Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and type 2 Diabetes.  Eventually they had to place a nutritional tube from her nose into her stomach.  She transitioned to high-flow oxygen which is a step up from the BiPAP machine.  This was promising news until the doctor informed us she didn't respond well to hi-flow.  She was put back on the BiPAP which broke our hearts; she was suffering but still fighting.  We truly felt hopeless until we received a phone call from the doctor informing us that Mom is back on hi-flow and doing better.  This was music to our ears!  A couple days later the nutritional tube was removed and she was eating pureed foods.  My heart suddenly felt hope again.  After being in the hospital for over a week, we were told she is using regular o2 and that she had her first solid meal!  Oatmeal with bananas for breakfast and salmon for lunch and dinner.  She was hungry!          After two weeks, Mom was finally discharged.  She was unable to stand or walk on her own after returning home.  Her insurance didn't cover any home health services so that she can get occupational or physical therapy.  Going to the bathroom and bathing seemed impossible.  After several days, she continued to gain strength and is now able to walk on her own.  She's eating anything we put in front of her, especially her strawberry shakes!  My brothers and sister all take turns in watching her, buying groceries, cooking meals, picking up medication, etc.  Someone is always with her.         As you can imagine, this has been a nightmare for our entire family.  Our parents are slowly recovering, but the road ahead is a long one. The burden our parents carry are their costly medical bills and so we are asking for help with the financial strain my parents face.         Thank you to everyone who loves our parents as much as we do, to those who have prayed and brought them comfort during this extremely difficult time.  \",\n",
       " \"Dear friends &amp; family- \\xa0 Much gratitude for your contributions &amp; support thus far!! You all are life savers and I could not do this without your support.\\xa0  Please see update for COVID19. \\xa0Unfortunately my mom unknowingly brought COVID19 home from the hospital working as a nurse before lockdown. This campaign was originally organized for Lyme treatment &amp; stem cells. Tragically I’m on the long haul and the infection has caused damage, making it challenging to walk, shower function etc. A friend just picked up some brand new wheels for me, a wheel chair, my ability to walk has been impaired at this time. I hope to receive stem cells to regenerate nerve, cardiac and lung damage. There are promising clinics where patients regained use of once numb limbs, regained mobility and ability to run/walk, and improved neuropathy. Any donations help &amp; please please share this campaign :)\\xa0  In addition I’d like to see UCLA specialists.  Thank you so much for your support, generosity and sharing this campaign. Many hands make light work &amp; I simply cannot do this alone, especially in my condition.  I’ve been regularly in &amp; out of doctors offices &amp; labs for the past 1.5 years. Your initial donations &amp; treatments have stabilized prior conditions &amp; helped tremendously, however recent labs show I’m not fully recovered &amp; I have recently been diagnosed with Lyme disease. (Wear bug spray please :))  \\xa0Nonetheless when I first got sick and was hospitalized 5 years after ago, I remained in good spirits, I unhooked myself from the hospital bed, &amp; played ukelele somewhere over the rainbow to elderly &amp; other patients in the corridors of the hospital (Trying to lighten the mood y’all :D )  However the reality of this situation is Lyme can shorten life spans if left untreated- I won’t get better without treatment or proper medical care. Our medical system is deeply faulted, there’s limitations to tests, treatments &amp; only so much that regular health care can provide.  There’s a state of the art stem cells clinic for Lyme &amp; Autoimmune &amp; can also help with COVID19 lung/nerve \\xa0damage, it’s safer because they’re ones own stem cells. A girlfriend who was in a similar \\xa0 health condition, recovered from Lyme after receiving this stem cell treatment, she’s back to life, healthy &amp; strong\\xa0:) For the first time in years she’s in remission and healed from Lyme from this life saving treatment, shes out of bed and up early in the morning jogging, going to conferences, working as a health coach (check out her blog at www.trailtohealth.com)  This stem cell treatment is costly but it’s life saving, effective &amp; worth it. Unlike treatments in countries abroad that sometimes use foreign stem cells, this treatment uses your own stem cells and is safer &amp; clinically proven effective with decades of university research. \\xa0(www.infusio.com)  I look forward to regaining health with this treatment! There’s nothing more I want in the world than to live a long healthy life, to travel, the ability to work on projects full time &amp; finish school (... and also world peace lol).  This stem cell therapy clinic has been around for over two decades, they use your own stem cells and are leading in their field. Stem cells regenerate cell tissue and will repair my body, organs &amp; joints. There are many cases proven to put Lyme and autoimmune into remission with this stem treatment.  Although life is full of beauty moments &amp; is truly a gift, this has also been a nightmare at times. I would like to get back to life, regain health &amp; live a long healthy life. Thank you so much for your support, I cannot do it without you.  Any amount of donations add up &amp; make a difference. THANK YOU ALL so much for your contributions thus far, also phone calls, prayers &amp; checking in with me, are always appreciated. It can be quite isolating at times being chronically ill.  It’s all greatly appreciated &lt;3  With deep GRATITUDE &amp; LOVE, Pam   P.S. Any large donations would be best to donate via PayPal to\\xa0[email redacted]\\xa0because go fund me takes a small percentage. Also Doctors say I’m not contagious in case you were worried.\\xa0  Thank you &amp; blessings.       (Old message from several years ago).  Dear Friends &amp; family,  Some of you may have heard that Pam has been having some health issues lately. This is a vast understatement. She’s been in the emergency room more times than I can count in the last few years, and this year it’s just become too much to handle. We all know how difficult it is to pay for health care in the states, and Pam’s various ailments—some of which have been life threatening—have racked up medical needs that she cannot possibly hope to handle alone. She needs our help.\\xa0She is hoping to get stem cell therapy as a final resort.\\xa0  It all started 3 summers ago when she accrued a chronic neck injury from a surfing accident in Venice. Duck diving under a wave, it cracked and ruptured two of her vertebrae. Grateful to still be walking, she was later disappointed to learn it would be a chronic painful life-long condition. She's lost 1 Inch in height due to the injury and its quite painful to do simple tasks such as sit upright for long periods, wear heals, &amp; lift everyday objects such as groceries. Chiropractics assert with a her immune system is down due to the grueling off the chart back pain it takes just to hold herself upright daily.  Each one of these health issues have the potential to halt a person’s world, let alone combined. Her bright, strong &amp; independent spirit is not enough to get her through this, she sincerely needs your support. Not one of these issues has been properly resolved, because Pam needs help paying for treatment that her insurance simply won’t cover.  Pam needs your help with the following treaments that have been effective in helping her heal.\\xa0  A stem cell therapy treatment that will give her back her energy and health. A stem cell therapy treatment based in Germany. For 20 years they regenerate ones own fat stem cells and intravenously infuse the stem cells back into the body. They have had tremendous success bringing people back to life from autoimmune and Lymes disease. Pam’s girlfriend had a severe case of Lymes in which she spent years with many days bed ridden, she is now “a morning person”, she’s awake early, with the energy to finish naturopath school and working full time as a Lymes health coach. It has been 4 years since Pam has got sick and she is still not well and not the same energetic person she used to be. She sleeps a lot, has days where it’s challenging to get out of bed, has very sore inflammed days in which her joints ache, her heart valve has noticeable wear. This life saving treatment is 20k.\\xa0  No one should have to go through all of this without help. Ongoing treatment will help heal her and she simply can’t pay for on her own because it is SO expensive. It will take thousands to get her the treatment she needs, and she is in no position to pay it. She needs us—her support, her community—to help jump start her healing process so that she can get back on track and continue what has been and will be (if she can get the help she needs) a life of heart led service &amp; authentic expression of gifts.  So here’s what I’m asking: 1) Please donate for Pam’s healing &amp; medical treatment. She’s not frivolous; she’s desperate. No amount is too small—absolutely everything counts. 2) Whether or not you donate, PLEASE give her a call or write her a message to check up on her. 3) If you are in a healing profession she would greatly appreciate any donated services. The worst thing in the world is to feel like you are all alone in what you are going through, and she’s been struggling for so long at this point that it could be easy for anyone to lose hope and resign oneself to this debilitating laundry list of medical issues. She deserves every ounce of support she can get, both financially and emotionally. Don’t think your kind words and your help won’t mean anything to her.  Individually and as a community, your support matters so much, so let’s do this! Let’s get our girl back in action and, most importantly, let’s show her some love and give her strength for the long road ahead.  Sincerely,  Fancy\",\n",
       " '  My name is far less important than the need this Go Fund Me represents...         The Morgan\\'s are some of the most incredibly kind people; it is my privilege to call them my friends. They have shown great consideration to the health of others through this entire pandemic. They wore masks, made countless more for others to wear, they sanitized, isolated and socially distanced; they did everything they were advised to do. When the vaccine was available and it was open for them to have their turn they took it, without hesitation, in order to continue their efforts with regards to preventing the spread of this insidious virus.           To spite their best efforts and continued vigilance when others had dropped their guards\\', Stephen Morgan, was hospitalized with COVID symptoms that caused breathing to become nearly impossible on his own. He is still recovering in intensive care with each breath coming from the assistance of a machine. It is a startling revelation that we are not out of danger yet, and even the strongest among us are still susceptible to the ravages of this disease.          This has caused untold devastation to not only his life, but the lives\\' of those that depend upon his presence and support. The medical bills alone, could be ruinous. We, as a community and as a united people,  find ourselves in a rare opportunity to do something purely right and just.  This family, with help from all of us, can find some peace from the worry of \"how will we ever recover from this?\" This is not an ailment that came from neglect or lack of prevention; this should never have happened. Please help to right this wrong.

After a few weeks in ICU he was able to be transferred to a hospital in his hometown of Allen to start a long recovery process of healing. His lungs were not working and he needed oxygen to be able to breathe. He could not breathe on his own. After a few weeks in that hospital he was able to leave and go home to finish his recovery.       Allen is doing much better but still has a long way to recover and to be able to return to work to provide for his family.       His Covid pandemic leave ran out and he is about to finish using his work sick hours.       I decided to create this fund because I can relate to him during this hard times. I know that every dollar that we are able to contribute for him and his family will help pay his medical bills and provide to his family.       I can’t imagine as the head of a household how he must feel, stressed and worried about how he will be able to put food on the table when your income goes to less than half of what you use to bring home and your bills are the same or more as before you became ill.      On behalf of Allen and his family, I thank all of you for taking the time to wish him well and pray for his quick recovery. I thank you in advance for all your donations to\\xa0 help him and his family so they don’t struggle even more during this difficult times.         ',\n",

After a month of being hospitalized and intubated due to Covid, unable to work and released in a weakened state, she lost her father who was hospitalized at the same time with his own Covid battle. He passed away and the mourning process has begun for her and the family. She has depleted all savings and has bills piling up with no end or relief in sight.

       " '  I’ve known Kathy for five months.         Why would I spend time creating a GoFundMe for someone I’ve known for only five months?         Because Kathy’s influence on me and thousands of others like me has been nothing short of life-changing. I found her after nearly 20 years of dealing with a medical condition I didn’t even know the name of.         Kathy and I have in common a chronic autoimmune disease called lichen sclerosus (LS). It’s not rare, but people don’t want to talk about it, so it can make you feel like you’re the only person in the world struggling with this disease.         But Kathy wants to talk about it. Kathy wants to talk about lichen sclerosus. All. The. Time. She wants to talk about it so much that younger generations and future generations will be aware of this disease and won’t have to go through the pain and suffering that millions before them did.         You discover this is Kathy’s passion the moment you find her, whether through her podcast, support group, DMs, or interviews with members of the medical community. She is knee-deep in the hard work it takes, giving 110% into everything she does, sometimes at the expense of her own sleep or time with her family members. She is building a community throughout the world where people can receive and provide emotional and mental support for lichen sclerosus.         But now Kathy’s work in the community has come to a halt. And she and her husband have a new disease to battle: COVID.         Kathy was hospitalized due to COVID on 9/28/21 with shortness of breath, heart flutters, and a blood oxygen level of 84. Her husband, Lorenzo, was admitted four days prior to the same hospital, also experiencing symptoms of COVID.         Kathy and Lorenzo spent a painful week apart from one another on different floors of the hospital, at first communicating through text. Then, even texting became too taxing. After several days in the hospital, Lorenzo’s condition wouldn’t stabilize. He had to be moved to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to be placed on a ventilator. Kathy’s condition stabilized, but she was fighting a secondary infection, pneumonia.         We are pleased to share that after one week of relying on oxygen therapy, battling pneumonia, and being unable to leave her bed for six days, Kathy has been discharged from the hospital as of 10/05/21. She is excited to continue her rehab at home with their two young daughters, but Lorenzo remains in the ICU at the hospital on a ventilator in serious condition. He is able to lay only on his stomach and requires 40 L of oxygen, but his blood oxygen is improving. Kathy is winded after spending six days immobile. She made it through the hospital stay, but she still needs to rest and recover and cannot return fully to her work within the community.         With Lorenzo being unable to work for the past two weeks, his employment status with his current frontline position is uncertain. Kathy is worried about making ends meet once out of the hospital, not to mention that Lorenzo’s condition remains serious. We don’t know at this point when Lorenzo will be well enough to head home to be with Kathy and their girls.         Kathy is asking for continued thoughts, prayers, and manifestations for Lorenzo.         But as a part of her community, we want to provide another opportunity to support her. We want to lift Kathy and Lorenzo up and help give back to someone who has given us so much. We welcome you to do the same.         Kathy has touched the lives of thousands through her podcast, support group, fundraising efforts to launch a not-for-profit, interviews, and professional relationships with the medical and health communities.         Through her work in the LS community, she has brought light into darkness, ushered in hope over fear, and for some, has provided the will to keep on living.         This ask for donations is not coming from Kathy. It’s coming from those who have been touched by Kathy’s dedication, generosity, and unwavering commitment to the LS community.         It’s the least we can do to give back to someone who continues to give so much.         100% of funds donated (minus any fees as required for using GoFundMe) will go directly to Kathy and her family to help cover rent for their home, utilities, electricity, food, expenses for their kids, and eventually medical bills.         Thank you so much for supporting Kathy, Lorenzo, and their family in whatever way you are able. If you feel led to do so, please share this GoFundMe page with your networks and contacts to help spread the word.         We will provide updates here on Kathy’s and Lorenzo’s progress as we receive them.              With love and positivity,    Emily | Friend of Kathy &amp; Lorenzo and Fellow LS Warrior  ',\n",
       " '  This fund is being created for our Mom, Elizabeth Roman. Mom tested positive for Covid and consequently was hospitalized because she developed double lung pneumonia. She has been in the hospital for 2 ½ weeks, with one of those weeks spent in the Intensive Care Unit. She remains hospitalized with no anticipated release date. She continues to need oxygen and respiratory therapy while she regains her strength. This is especially difficult for Mom due to her pre-existing fibromyalgia and asthma.          We know that recovering from Covid and pneumonia has and will continue to be challenging for her and although we are hopeful she will make a full recovery, she will need time away from work to rest and focus on healing.          Mom does not like to ask for help, so we, her children, are asking for help on her behalf. Her current employer does not offer health insurance or sick leave. Any and all funds collected will be used to pay for her medical expenses and wages lost as a result of her hospitalization. We are so appreciative of all the love and support that our family and friends have bestowed on us during this difficult time. Please continue to uplift her and cover her with prayers of healing and encouragement.          Warmly,     Karen, Javier &amp; Cathya                    Este fondo está siendo creado para nuestra mamá, Elizabeth Roman. Mami dio positivo por Covid y, por consiguiente, fue hospitalizada porque desarrolló neumonía pulmonar doble. Ha estado en el hospital durante 2 semanas y media, y una de esas semanas la ha pasado en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos. Mami permanece hospitalizada sin fecha prevista. Ella continúa necesitando oxígeno y terapia respiratoria mientras recupera sus fuerzas. Esto es especialmente difícil para mami debido a su fibromialgia y asma. Reconocemos que la recuperación de Covid y la neumonía sera un reto para ella y, aunque esperamos que ella haga una recuperación completa, necesitará tiempo libre del trabajo para descansar y centrarse en su recuperación.         A mami no le gusta pedir ayuda, así que nosotros, sus hijos, estamos pidiendo ayuda en su nombre. Su empleador no provee seguro médico ni baja por enfermedad. Los fondos recaudados serán utilizados para pagar sus gastos médicos y salario perdido como resultado de su hospitalización. Estamos tan agradecidos de todo el amor y apoyo que nuestra familia y amigos nos han brindado durante este tiempo difícil. Por favor continúen levantándola y cubriéndola con oraciones de sanidad y aliento.         Afectuosamente,    Karen, Javier y Cathya             ',\n",

She has been hospitalized five times and spent the first few months of recovery entirely bedridden. While Erica has come a long way, she is still seriously ill with chronic, post-COVID health complications. We’re asking for your help in supporting her ongoing recovery!     As a result of COVID, Erica has been diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Dysautonomia, severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and several other serious chronic conditions. She regularly sees seven specialist doctors, takes many medications and supplements, and continues to undergo invasive tests and procedures.     COVID and its aftermath have completely changed Erica’s life. One year later, she still can't walk for more than a minute or climb the stairs to her apartment. She can’t drive, make her own food, or do any household tasks. She hasn’t been able to play music or sing. She can’t hold a long conversation or look at screens for an extended period of time. She has vision and speech difficulties and cannot draw, read, or write. She lives with a very high level of daily chronic pain. While her doctors are optimistic that her health and quality of life will continue to improve, they all agree - recovery will take a long time.     We’re planning for at least another year of continued medical treatment before Erica may be able to return to work. To support her during this time, we’re raising money to cover healthcare costs and living expenses including:     Medical debt from this past year: $6,000     Medical expenses for the next year: $9,000     ul   li Rehabilitation center  /li    li Medical tests  /li    li Hotel for rehab center  /li    li Doctor appointments  /li    li Medical equipment  /li    li Medications and supplements  /li    li Transportation  /li    /ul   Living Expenses: 5,000     ul   li Rent, utilities, groceries  /li    /ul   Total: $20,000     Chances are, you’ve met Erica and know what a light she is in this world.

       " 'This fundraiser is for Lizze Buchanan, a 25-year-old RN with a BSN of three years who will be graduating as a Nurse Practitioner in Spring 2021. She\\'s not only my soon to be sister-in-law, but she is easily one of the kindest, funniest and most thoughtful people I\\'ve ever met.\\xa0  On December 19, Lizze was diagnosed with Covid-19, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia. She was hospitalized four days later after experiencing severe trouble breathing. After two days in the hospital, she had to be rushed to the ICU in the middle of the night because her oxygen levels were so dangerously low.  Lizze is still in the ICU fighting low oxygen levels, a blood infection and fluid in her lungs. She can\\'t keep her oxygen level above 75% without the 55 liters of oxygen per minute she\\'s currently receiving, and has to wear a BiPAP machine on and off to push air into her lungs since hers aren\\'t strong enough.  We don\\'t know when Lizze will be able to come home, but we know her recovery won\\'t be easy. We’re told it could take months of rehabilitation, physical therapy and other treatments associated with full recovery. We are trying to raise money for the medical and living costs she’ll be facing once she’s out of the hospital, such as the respiratory equipment that will be critical to her at-home recovery.  We appreciate all of the support, prayers and kind words we have received from family and friends over the last week. If you can please keep Lizze in your thoughts and help her with any amount, it would mean the world to us. Thank you all so much in advance for your love and generosity!   strong PLEASE NOTE /strong : Any money we raise over $8,000 that does not go to her medical or living expenses will be donated to St. Peter\\'s Hospital. The teams there have done an amazing job taking care of Lizze, unfortunately they\\'re facing a serious supply shortage that is impacting the level of support they can provide to patients. (Due to limited availabilities of thermometers and pulse oximeters, Lizze could only have her temperature taken every eight hours and we\\'ve had to buy our own pulse oximeters for her.) Not having the right tools delayed the care Lizze needed, and so any extra dollars will be put towards making sure they have the essential tools to prevent this in the future.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53559504_1609109731798792_r.jpeg\" alt=\"53559504_1609109731798792_r.jpeg\"     /    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53559504_1609109712146816_r.jpeg\" alt=\"53559504_1609109712146816_r.jpeg\"     /   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53559504_1609109762437434_r.jpeg\" alt=\"53559504_1609109762437434_r.jpeg\"     / ',\n",

       " '   strong *Versión en Español Más Abajo* /strong      (I am sharing this on behalf of my sweet fiancé, Alejandro, and in-laws)     Hello all, we are Miguel Alejandro and Marco and come to you with a humble heart to share some news.     Around late June, my parents have come into the very unfortunate situation of contracting COVID-19 in Venezuela, especially my dad in his elderly age, severely affected by the virus. He has progressed into phase 3 COVID-19 with pneumonia.     Being in Venezuela means that there is very limited access to medical care; there is no equipment/materials in hospitals, fuel, or food. To find medicine and oxygen is difficult and costly, with no possibility of medical insurance or help from the government.     Both my parents are recovering at home. Doctors have acknowledged my dad\\'s situation, rendering that he would need to be properly hospitalized but that\\'s not possible due to the country\\'s situation. Hospitals have become death traps where no medicine nor equipment is available. Recurrent power outages make this scenario increasingly riskier.     Therefore, we have doctors visiting our parents and a nurse taking care of my dad. My mom took full care of him but after a couple of weeks of this demanding task, being sick as well, she needed extra help to avoid getting sicker herself. She is on her way to recovery now.     Due to the collapsed economy and hyperinflation, oxygen supply for one month, for example, is around $960 without transportation costs. Medicine, difficult as it is to find, is overpriced and sold in US dollars. My family and loved ones there are doing all they can to find what they need and take care of him, but they rely fully on my brother and me.     Everything costs more than usual and sending money from Spain or the US comes with a cost, losing a significant share of what we actually send.     This isn\\'t something I would ever like to see myself doing, asking for help in this way, but I am left to choose between this and to leave my parents, especially my dad in his severe condition, without proper care.     My brother and I, both currently living in Spain and working as freelancers, are facing this challenge the best we can. So far every need has been covered and will continue to be this way.     However, our savings will soon run out and we must figure out a way to continue providing.     We currently have estimated expenses of $3,660 per month, without including special medicines and equipment. For disclosure, these expenses include oxygen supply, nursing, blood testing, food, medical supplies, fuel and transportation, house cleaning, doctor’s visits, and renting an oxygen concentrator machine. You can see my estimates below.     The doctor who has been dedicated to helping us since the very beginning has recently informed us that, after this highly critical phase, a long-term recovery process will be necessary. Special testing will be needed, along with physical therapy and other procedures so he can reattain his quality of life.     This will be a long process indeed, but we are all determined to go through it bravely and successfully, with our parents coming out of it stronger than ever.     Anything you can offer to help, whatever it is, will go directly to the care of my parents in their recovery and will always be greatly appreciated!     \\xa0     \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/58751725_1627394948219545_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     \\xa0     \\xa0      strong *Español* /strong      (Comparto esto por parte de mi querido prometido, Alejandro, y mis suegros)     Hola a todos. Somos Miguel Alejandro y Marco y venimos a compartir con humildad una historia.     A finales de junio, nuestros papás se han visto en la muy desafortunada situación de contraer COVID-19 en Venezuela, especialmente nuestro papá con su edad, viéndose seriamente afectado por el virus. Su condición ha progresado hasta ser COVID-19 en fase 3 con neumonía.     Estar en Venezuela implica que existen serias limitaciones en todo lo relacionado a la salud y al cuidado sanitario; no hay equipamiento ni materiales en los hospitales, así como la seria escasez de gasolina y productos de primera necesidad. Conseguir las medicinas necesarias y el oxígeno, del cual depende a diario, es difícil y muy costoso, con ninguna posibilidad de acceder a los beneficios de un seguro privado o sanidad por parte del Estado.     Tanto nuestra mamá como papá se están recuperando en casa. Los doctores han reconocido que, en el estado que se encuentra mi papá, debería estar hospitalizado y recibiendo tratamiento intensivo pero esto no es posible debido a la situación sanitaria que se vive en el país. Los hospitales se han convertido en patíbulos donde no se proveen los cuidados necesarios. Los cortes en el servicio eléctrico hacen de esta situación aún más precaria.     Por ende, los doctores están visitando a nuestros papás con regularidad y una enfermera se encuentra ahora en casa para atender todas las necesidades posibles.     Nuestra mamá se estaba encargando de todos los cuidados pero después de un par de semanas de esta demandante labor, estando ella enferma igualmente, era necesaria la ayuda de alguien más para no enfermarse aún mas. Ahora se ha encontrado un descanso, se encuentra recuperándose.     Debido al colapso de la economía y a la hiperinflación, el suministro de oxígeno para un mes, por ejemplo, nos ha costado alrededor de $960 sin costos de transporte. Medicinas, tan difíciles de conseguir, se venden con sobreprecio y en dólares americanos. Mi familia y todos nuestros seres queridos están haciendo todo lo que pueden para conseguir lo necesario y colaborar, pero nuestros padres continúan siendo económicamente dependientes de nosotros.     Todo cuesta más de lo usual y enviar el dinero desde España o Estados Unidos viene con un costo, lo que nos lleva a perder una parte del dinero que enviamos.     Esto no es algo que a mí o a mi hermano nos hubiese gustado hacer en ningún momento de nuestras vidas, pedir ayuda de esta manera, pero nos queda elegir entre esto o dejar a nuestros papás, especialmente a papá, sin los cuidados que necesitan.     Mi hermano y yo, viviendo en España y trabajando como autónomos, estamos enfrentando este reto lo mejor que podemos. De momento hemos cubierto todos y cada uno de los gastos que han sido necesarios y así seguirá.     Sin embargo, nuestros ahorros se están agotando y estamos buscando las vías para seguir proveyendo.     Ahora mismo tenemos unos gastos estimados de $3.660 al mes, sin incluir el tratamiento especial que los médicos han sugerido y compras de equipamiento puntuales. Para mayor transparencia, estos gastos incluyen suministro de oxígeno, enfermera, exámenes de laboratorio, alimentación, suministros médicos, gasolina y transporte, limpieza de la casa, visitas de los doctores y el alquiler de un concentrador de oxígeno. Adjuntamos una tabla con todos los detalles.     La doctora que ha estado comprometida con nosotros desde el primer momento nos ha informado que después de esta fase crítica, un largo periodo de recuperación será necesario. Serán requeridas pruebas especiales junto a fisioterapia y otros procedimientos para que poco a poco nuestro papá recupere su calidad de vida.     En efecto, este será un largo proceso pero estamos determinados a enfrentarlo y superarlo con valentía y de forma exitosa, con nuestros padres saliendo de esto más fuertes que nunca.     Cualquier ayuda ofrecida, sea lo que sea, irá directo a la recuperación de nuestros papás y siempre será enormemente agradecida. ¡Muchas gracias!     \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/58751725_1627395049216011_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0  ',\n",

       " 'A little more than a month ago, our precious aunt Lily began the fight of her life after falling ill with COVID and being admitted to the hospital. Nobody would ever have dreamed this incredible woman of strength, a firecracker full of love and life would be in the percentage of those battling the most severe of symptoms with this virus.\\xa0 Within a matter of days her lungs could no longer support her body.\\xa0 After transferring to ICU, she was placed on a ventilator and her condition continued to deteriorate.\\xa0 \\xa0As she neared the 3 week point of being vented, doctors were giving a grim prognosis - words no family ever wants to hear.\\xa0 I want to share the words from her children, shared on social media to update friends and family on August 2nd, the day before an important meeting with her doctors.\\xa0\\xa0  \"As most of you already know, our world was turned upside down &amp; inside out a few weeks ago. A very significant part of our lives, the heart and glue to our family was hospitalized. Although her condition is severe, those of you who know her, know what a strong, resilient woman she is. We have full faith that our Lily, our Mother, our Ganny, will come back home to us, but she needs help. If you all could please keep her in your prayers, to make a quick recovery because time is of the essence. We can\\'t imagine a world without her, but most importantly our babies need their Ganny. It hurts my heart more than anything to think that Kane could possibly grow up not remembering how wonderful, how much love, and how much a part of his life she was. I won\\'t accept it, I won\\'t give up and I know she isn\\'t either. I have full faith that God is listening and the more prayers going up, the better!\"  By the end of that week, a miraculous transition took place.\\xa0 We received a phone call that literally brought us to our knees in praise.\\xa0 The staff decided to try and wake Lily to see how responsive she was.\\xa0 When she responded well, they decided to extubate her, cautiously.\\xa0 Again, I want to share the words of her children, this update from August 7th:  \"Are you all ready for this??!! Lily Riner Turner is following commands!! She is squeezing their hands, raising her arms and blinking her eyes for them, weakly but as much to be expected. She is currently OFF the ventilator!!!!! She is using a C-pap w a mask. They are monitoring her closely just in case they have to reinsert the vent, but so far she is doing well with out it Thank you God!!!\"  Lily has since continued to improve leaps and bounds, day by day.\\xa0 While her lungs are still a mess, within 2 days they had her on a nasal cannula and off the bi-pap.\\xa0 As of today, they are planning to pull her feeding tube to attempt a regular diet by mouth and begin working with speech therapy.\\xa0\\xa0  She has a very long road ahead, and will most certainly transition to rehab once she receives 2 negative COVID tests and her condition is stable enough.\\xa0 We ask that you please continue to pray for her in the coming days, as well as the rest of the family - especially her husband Randy who will need strength and support to care for her.\\xa0 There are so many unknowns about the lasting impacts this virus causes, but we know what a warrior Lily is and if anyone can overcome, it\\'s her. She has always been a pillar and the most hardworking, selfless individual. She lights up a room with her joy and laughter, and her love for her family is evident in all she does and gives of herself.\\xa0\\xa0   strong All of this said - she is also the breadwinner for her family, as Randy is disabled.

He\\'s been hospitalized since and requires constant oxygen flow in order to just basically exist.

Shane is currently at Grand Strand, but with any luck he will be transferred to a more specialized facility in Mt.

       " 'Hi Everyone,   We want to share an update about how our mom, Andrea Magana is doing. At the beginning of the year she caught COVID and had to be hospitalized as it developed into Covid Pneumonia. The first few days in the hospital were scary as the infection in her lungs had begun to leach into her blood causing sepsis.   Since being hospitalized and receiving medication and oxygen her condition has begun to stabilise and improve. She is no longer in sepsis, but remains hospitalised till her condition improves enough to come home. This came on very quickly, and we are not sure how long the healing process will take.

One of the hardest things about COVID is not being able to visit our mom while she is in the hospital, talking on the phone is also very hard for her as it uses a lot of oxygen and it is hard to hear over the machines.   We are able to have items delivered to her room if you would like to send a card to our home we can drop it off for her. Video messages that she can watch are also so encouraging. I will be putting together a video compilation so that she can watch it on a larger screen/higher volume.\\xa0   If you would like more information about one of these options send us a message.   strong Finances: /strong  We do know that there will be a financial need in the coming weeks as medical bills begin to arrive and time off work takes its toll.

For these reasons, he was hospitalized on August 1st.\\xa0 The doctors and nurses decided that in order to keep him as comfortable as possible, that it was best to keep him sedated. My dad was working full time before he became hospitalized. He had enough saved up the first month to cover his bills, but unfortunately that is no longer the case.

Grace's condition is delicate, however, thank God in recent days she has shown improvement. However, her health insurance has not covered all costs, and will not cover future expenses. This is why, we turn to your good heart and wish to contribute a grain of sand to help Wilson and Grace in this fight. We appreciate your goodwill in advance. God bless you.    Son tiempos difíciles para todos. La salud se ha visto resquebrajada y la economía de las familias ha recibido un duro golpe también. Sin embargo, la solidaridad ha florecido y nos ha llenado de esperanza. Hoy, el hogar de nuestros grandes amigos, Wilson y Grace se ha visto golpeado. El covid llegó y afectó la salud de los dos. Wilson se ha mantenido en casa, con atención permanente y a pesar de que está mucho mejor, todavía no supera del todo la enfermedad. Por otro lado, Grace tuvo que ser hospitalizada, lleva varios días en terapia intensiva recibiendo grandes cantidades de oxígeno y luchado por salir adelante. La condición de Grace es delicada, sin embargo, gracias a Dios en los últimos días ha mostrado mejoría. El seguro médico no cubre la totalidad de lo gastado hasta hoy y no cubrirá los gastos futuros. Es por esto, que como su círculo más cercano, acudimos al buen corazón de familiares, amigos, conocidos y todas aquellas personas que quieran y puedan contribuir con un granito de arena para ayudar a Wilson y Grace en esta lucha. La preocupación por lo económico nunca debería quitarnos fuerza y energía para luchar por lo vital. Desde ya agradecemos su buena voluntad. Que Dios les bendiga.\",\n",
       " '  COVID-19 is something that has impacted the lives of many. But as humans, we try to push that out of our heads, and hope that it doesn’t happen to you or your loved ones. But as careful, and hopeful as we are, COVID managed to knock on our front door, leaving Alex Ruiz hospitalized and his entire family scrambling to keep everything together. But as many families know, it is always easier said than done.     \\xa0     Alex Ruiz is a uncle, brother, cousin, son, father, husband and a friend to many. He’s a selfless man, who gives and asks nothing in return. He’s a hard worker, and a fighter. And he’s proven nothing less while being hospitalized. Through prayer, family, community, and his own grit, he’s been able to persevere through weeks of treatment at a clinic in Lamesa. We have been lucky enough to have him transferred to a hospital in San Antonio, where he is able to continue his road to recovery. We recognize it is going to be a long one, but nevertheless, he will come out on top of it, because his story is one he will tell.     \\xa0     We are eternally grateful for all of the nurses, doctors, and other medical staff for the amount of support and prayer we have received; we couldn’t have asked for better staff, who at this point, became family.     \\xa0     As we approach the month mark, we humbly ask for any support you can give, whether that be money, prayer, love, or just positive vibes. Everything and anything helps. We reach out to the community with nothing but love and good faith. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank everyone who has been able to show their support and send positive thoughts. We pray for a good, healthy recovery and thank everyone in advance.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59604371_1630280328664816_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"59604371_1630280328664816_r.jpeg\" /       img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59604371_1630280314636314_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"59604371_1630280314636314_r.jpeg\" /      \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59604371_1630276785664298_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59604371_1630276811997267_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59604371_163027690285209_r.\" alt=\"\"     /    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59604371_1630280420462395_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"59604371_1630280420462395_r.jpeg\" /   ',\n",
       " '  Our beloved friend and community member needs our assistance and support. Despite being fully vaccinated, Patrick unfortunately contracted the Delta variant of Covid, and has been hospitalized for the past two weeks. While he is expected to make a full recovery (thank you God!!), he has experienced significant loss of income from not being able to work during this long illness. He needs our help to pay for his rent and expenses and to make another repair on his beloved Red Rover. (Side note: If anyone has a reliable car that they are no longer in need of and would like to donate somewhere, that would be an incredible gift to him as he has been making near constant repairs on the Red Rover.) We are setting the goal for $3000 to pay for his rent and utilities for August and September and to help with his car repair bill and to provide a small cushion as it may take more time for him to get fully back on his feet. Any amount that you can contribute will help to defray the burden he now faces. Thank you.  ',\n",
       " \"   Hi, my name is Erica Lynn, some also know me as Elynn. I'm fundraising to pay for the medical bills I incurred while I was recovering from Covid. My story is not that unusual for people who recovered from Covid, however, I am one of the very early survivors. Our stories are full of unknowns, no known treatments, and ongoing debilitating symptoms with no answers. I had Covid early, when testing wasn't working or adequate, and when no one understood how to treat this illness.       \\xa0       When I started to write this, I had no intention of it being this long. So for those who don't want to read the entire story, the bottom line is this: I fought for my life with Covid in April of 2020. I am doing so much better and I'm medically stable. But now I'm trying to get back on my feet and I don't see that happening without asking for help. I'm drowning now in medical and credit debt. I incurred $48,500 in debt while fighting this disease. This includes medical bills, personal loans, lost income and savings. Right now I'm just hoping for help to pay off the bills that are most pressing-like very very pressing. I can't ask friends or family at this time because they've been carrying me since March when my disability was suddenly denied. (I owe them money too even if they said it wasn't a loan!)       \\xa0       For those who are interested in my story, or don't know how this disease can affect a person, read on.       \\xa0       Thank you for caring and even if you can't give, I appreciate your caring.       \\xa0        strong Transmission: /strong  How did I get it? We don't really know but most likely community spread. In February, our city of Kirkland, WA was reeling from the outbreak at a local senior living community. My partner is a firefighter for the city of Kirkland. Our family showed symptoms in mid March. I started feeling ill the last week in March and by the 2nd week in April I had full blown Covid symptoms: extreme fatigue, a persistent fever that lasted 26 days, a cough that was constant, body aches and pains, lethargy and confusion. I felt like I was going to die, and I was too tired to be upset about it. I was too sick to even realize that at this time, I was fighting for my life.       \\xa0        strong Isolation: /strong  I wanted to talk to my kids, to see them. I could do neither. Talking caused sever coughing spasms and made me feel like an elephant was sitting on my chest. at this time we still didn't know how long I could be contagious, or if you could get it again, so the only answer was strict quarantine and isolation. I was blessed to have my best friend live with me at this time. Krissy was a godsend to me. I am forever grateful. I know she spent many nights listening to my coughing and checking to see if I was still breathing. She has told me how scared she was. Again, I will never be able to express my gratitude to have been loved so much by her.       \\xa0        strong Night Terrors: /strong  During this time I began to have night terrors. I think I was awake, but I can't be sure. I spent many nights thinking someone was in my room, a few times I swear I felt a hand on my shoulder. I would try and shake myself into lucidity, to get away. I never saw anyone. I felt a dark presence that can only be described as predatory. These nights were the worst. I will never forget the mental assault the night time put upon me. Every night was a fight, a battle. Morning would come, I would fall into a complete coma-like sleep for a few hours. There was no real 'rest' with covid. There was extreme fatigue but sleep wasn't pleasant or consistent. I slept whenever and wherever I could. I still could not shake the feeling of extreme fatigue.       \\xa0        strong Medical Care/Hospital /strong : Like many of us who suffer from Post Viral Syndrome or 'Long Haul Covid', even though I had bad symptoms, I wasn't hospitalized. I had a visit to the ER one night when I could not stop coughing, but other than that I was only seeing my doctor via video due to the need to quarantine. When my cough began to improve and I could talk again, I tried to return to work. The problem was I was still so exhausted, and I wasn't feeling myself. I felt like I was underwater, I couldn't process language or understand the simplest of things. I was barely there. I was missing many days, I was there but really not. I tried to make appointments and set up meetings, I tried running reports, but I would end up so exhausted and confused I'd have to call out sick. It didn't take long for this to be noticed.       \\xa0        strong My Employer:  /strong I was blessed with a very good work family. Not only did they support me while I was trying to return to work, they were very compassionate and understanding that I was just not well. I was still sick. I needed more time to heal.       \\xa0       The catalyst that really pushed my health to a point where I needed to be on full time disability started in September when I noticed I was feeling especially tired and confused (brain fog). I noticed a rash had started on my thighs, then quickly it was on my back, by torso, arms, and it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. This rash was like having heat on your skin, itchy, stinging heat. It looked like a type of hives but it was acting like Shingles. My nerves started feeling like I was being stung by bees all over my body. I wasn't able to sleep at all. The pain could be anywhere at anytime. One time (this is an overshare but you gotta know how bad this was) I was on the couch and suddenly felt this shock followed by another in my bottom. Like, IN MY BOTTOM. Anyway, you get the idea. This thing had no rules, no timeline, no manners. The rash was healed by October, but has since returned twice. Medication is the only thing that kept it under control.       \\xa0       This new nerve pain symptom was so strange, and it was worse at night, so I was suffering constantly. No sleep and constant pain. My doctor prescribed gabapentin. We started with a low dose. It made me tired and I slept a little. We increased the dosage. I still suffered. We increased the dosage. Now I still suffered and was constantly half asleep. We reached max dosage, I was told it would take 4-6 weeks to get used to the fatigue from the medication. I was prescribed sleeping medication because even with the fatigue I was only sleeping 10 minutes to an hour at a time. Eventually the gabapentin was working and I got used to it it. So the fatigue was not longer due to the medication, it was just the residual symptom from Covid.       \\xa0       Other symptoms that occurred during this time: balance issues, feeling like I was constantly confused, memory issues, word confusion, increased fatigue and body aches, night terrors and insomnia. The rash healed, but the nerve pain was still there. I fell and twisted my knee (due to the balance issue). I was already sedentary but this made me even more so. I saw a neurologist, I had a brain MRI. Normal. I saw a rheumatologist and we ran tests. Nothing fit any box of our options for diagnosis. I was told that Covid made my body overreact and that I probably had Post Viral Syndrome.       \\xa0       I had the realization in January that I had plateaued. I wasn't getting worse, but I wasn't any better either. Depression began to visit regularly. Then it moved right in and wasn't budging. My doctor added anti-anxiety medication and we tried 3 different sleeping medications. Nothing helped.       \\xa0       It wasn't until February I noticed I was feeling slightly better. I started having some good days. But I wasn't able to reliably have those good days. I was still fighting to get back to a new normal, to be able to work, to live.       \\xa0       March almost completely did me in. I was starting to feel hopeful for recovery, but my disability insurance was reviewing my claim and decided to convert it into a long term claim with a whole new set of qualifications. I stopped receiving payments. I started calling weekly. I provided everything that was requested and they would then ask for more. I began to feel increasingly anxious. How was I going to live without an income?       \\xa0        strong Hope: /strong  In April, I was fortunate to get my first Covid vaccine shot. I didn't feel any different afterwards. Just hopeful for our world that we might get through it. I got my second dose in May. I didn't start feeling different for a few weeks, but then I started to find my stride, I was able to get up in the morning. I was doing housekeeping and taking care of myself again. I was able to read a book. I was gaining stamina to get through my day. I still had a problem from the fall with my knee though.       \\xa0       My knee injury ended up needing surgery for a torn meniscus. I went for it and go the surgery. I needed it to start getting back into physical condition again. Because I was feeling better, I wasn't as upset about this hurdle in front of me. I had beat Covid, I had managed my symptoms, I was forging ahead. I could handle recovering from this minor surgery.       \\xa0       The week after my surgery, I returned to work. A week after that, I went on a work trip to Alaska for 5 days. I was able to do all of this again. Now I had to start learning my job again. This required all of my cognitive and physical focus. But I was finally able to do these things.       \\xa0       I will forever have permanent symptoms from Covid. I have an autoimmune disease that was triggered by Covid but is 'new' and there is no name for it. We treat symptoms as they arise. But I am blessed to be medically stable.       Knowing all this is one thing, but the truth is it is just eating away at me, I am so scared of what will happen if I can't get a grip on this portion of my recovery. Ironically, it feels like I recovered only to get buried in debt. It's been so hard to stay positive.       \\xa0        strong Finances:  /strong Up until January I was doing ok. I'd had only about 60% of my income since becoming ill, but I was receiving some assistance through my short term disability policy. They didn't pay regularly, and every month they set the date to cancel my claim while I reapplied for the same illness for the same coverage. I made it work. I'd used all of my savings at this point. I was still able to contribute to my household. That all ended in March 2021 with the denial of my 'new long term' claim. I am forced to appeal this and may need legal representation to do so. I have no idea where to even start.       \\xa0       By May 1st I was tapped out. I couldn't contribute my share to our household. The debt continued to grow. By the time I returned to work, waited for my first paycheck, my checking account was so overdrawn that I only had $56 after my first check back. That $56 was pulled immediately by one of my hungry creditors.       \\xa0       Anything you can do to help me is appreciated. For those who know me, you know I work very hard and I am an honest and proud person. This is really difficult for me to ask. Thank you for listening and being here for me.       \\xa0       Bless you and yours,       \\xa0       Erica Lynn       Elynn       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0   \",\n",
       " \"  This GoFundMe has been organized to help the Howell family with the expenses and the stress that comes with difficult times. As most of you know, Gini Howell recently fell ill with the COVID-19 virus, was hospitalized, intubated and place in the COVID CCU ward. The Lord placed his healing hands on her and she came off the ventilator after 16 days. The illness and the hospital visit took a lot out of her, especially with the underlying Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer. Gini has been transferred to the Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids for a minimum of 6 weeks. The rehab facility has requested that Dave and Amanda be there with Gini while she is doing her occupational, speech, and physical therapies so they can continue with it after she is released. Having said that, the cost of travel and lodging is an added expense along with the copays for the hospital and rehab stays. These expenses have created a burden that I am sure is an added stressor to this whole situation. We thank you all for the continued thoughts and prayers. Please if you don't feel comfortable with donating to this fundraiser page another option is to Gini's PayPal. (Contact Amanda Howell for Gini's email address)    We thank you for all your prayers, love and support. God Bless!  \",\n",
       " '  Hi, my name is Jean and I’m looking to help alleviate the burden to my great Aunt and uncle- Raymond and Sharon Gravel.      Raymond and Sharon are home being cared for by their daughter, after being hospitalized following a Covid-19 diagnosis.     Unfortunately, 2 of their 3 children live out of state, so their care is left to their only local child, their daughter-Terry.     Terry had to give up her job, and only source of income, to care for her parents. Terry is also a single mom, trying to care for her child—and now her very ill parents.    Raymond is a Vietnam War Veteran and Sharon has been undergoing cancer treatment. Sharon has been in remission in the past, but sadly, the cancer returned. Raymond is also in poor health due to a triple bypass heart surgery and  COPD. Their health issues left them vulnerable to Covid.     The expenses are adding up quickly. Medical supplies, gas, additional cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks, oxygen tanks, etc.    It all adds up quickly.     Now comes facing the added expense of much needed home health care to exhausted family on top of everyday bills.     Every agency is telling the family caretakers that there’s simply not enough staff for workers to be available. The VA is also offering no assistance for care, when family last checked.     Private hired care may be the only option to the around the clock care Uncle Raymond and Aunt Sharon now require.     The last thing any one should worry about is how they can afford to care for their ill loved ones.        ',\n",

       " 'Three months ago my older brother, Jose Macias (57 years old), tested positive with COVID over in Mexico. After a few days of feeling sick at home, he unfortunately ended up hospitalized and intubated. It wasn’t until a few months later that he was extubated and discharged home after a complicated stay. Throughout this hard time he was heavily supported by all of his family and friends spanning Mexico, Massachusetts, and Texas. While there were many tears shed and guilt for not being able to physically be present due to the current restrictions, together we prayed for his return back home. Our prayers were answered and he is now back home and reunited with his lovely wife, daughter, and son. We are very grateful for this and are continuing to pray for the best possible recovery. His long hospital stay and need for intensive physical therapy carry their own burdens however. I would like to ask for your help and generosity in helping me help my brother.

       " '  Hey everyone,    I’m not sure if you know. My Sister Lisa got Covid at the end of March of this year. She got hit pretty hard and had to be hospitalized for over 2 weeks. Sadly…she acquired Covid Pneumonia and has had quite a tough time recovering. While hospitalized, her vital signs were scary. Her oxygen level would dip into the 70’s, B/P would go as low as 50/30’s, and pulse would plummet to the 30-40’s. While hospitalized she experienced a fall as a result of being so compromised. Once she was discharged, she was sent home with Home Health Services that included nursing care and physical therapy due to her physically weakened state and respiratory status. Her condition has remained only fair along her difficult path to recovery. Since her Covid onset, she has been on medical leave from her job - She has since been “let go” from her place of employment. You see, Lisa is a Physical Therapist Assistant which requires her to work with patients while lifting/walking/standing/bending/regular ongoing communication; all of which she is not able to barely exert herself with. She is very easily fatigued and short of breath when attempting to carry out any of these tasks herself even minimally. Her heart rate/blood pressure/oxygen status still plummet intermittently. Lisa’s doctors have also placed her on driving restrictions directly related to unwell present state so even if she wanted to drive to a job, she cannot safely do so. She has also been denied her short-term disability since June and has received no income since. Sadly, she has been forced to borrow money and withdraw money from her credit card to pay for bills. Lisa has appealed the decision for her short-term disability although she is just waiting and waiting while trying to survive and recover. They do not know enough about Covid’s long-term effects. Lisa has an upcoming appointment with a Covid Clinic Specialist to address her breathing, cardiac issues, and fatigue. She is currently at an understanding that she will be losing her health insurance shortly. Lisa has been inundated with medical appointments that include specialized testing. As you can see, not only has Lisa been fighting to get well, but she is also fighting to pay her current bills and needs help paying for foreseeable future expenses as well. She could genuinely use our help right now. She won’t ask…but I will.             ',\n",
       " \"  Covid 19 has affected us all! Some more severely than others. For the last several weeks David and Nicole Robertson and some of their extended family have been in a literal life or death battle with Covid. Nicole was hospitalized with Covid Pneumonia and the flu, while David, sick with Covid himself, took care of their two young boys William and Jacob. Gratefully, Nicole responded well to treatment and was released to continue with in home oxygen treatments. Unfortunately, David was hospitalized the same day Nicole was discharged. The doctors found blood clots in his fluid filled lungs, and his oxygen saturation was very low. His condition continued to worsen, he texted me that he was literally fighting to stay alive. Gratefully after much prayer from friends and family from across the globe, combined with medical treatments, David's numbers have begun to improve.                   However, this untimely sickness came right after David excepted a new unsalaried business coaching contract. Which meant Nicole would leave her job to be a full time mother, they'd move to Dallas, Texas and David would begin serving this new role. But, they did not foresee this sickness, nor the financial burden and uncertainty it would bring. The Robertson's health insurance coverage, provided through Nicole's former employer, has run out and while David's condition is improving a timeline back to work is uncertain.                   This family, who has loved and served so many in the communities they've called home, is now in need of our support. Will you consider joining me in donating funds to offset their impending medical bills and living expenses, as well as continue to pray for their rapid recovery.                   Lawrence  \",\n",

Brian and Rebecca are the mom and dad, and Reagan and McKenzie are their beautiful daughters, and all 4 have tested positive for Covid. Brian was the first to get sick in the first week of August, and then everyone else followed suite. They were all hoping to quarantine at home, but ultimately, Brian had to be hospitalized, as his pulse oximeter numbers at home were reading at 79. He was admitted to the ICU in Delray Medical Center where he was put on the highest level of oxygen thru a nasal cannula. He was able to step down to a regular room on 8/21/21, and has finally been able to walk for very short periods before getting extremely winded. His 20 year old daughter, Reagan, who has Down Syndrome, was also admitted with Covid a couple of days ago. My sister, Rebecca, was not allowed to stay with her, and needless to say, this created added stress, as Reagan cannot communicate very well. The hospital took good care of her and she was able to FaceTime her family at home. The nurses even arranged for Brian and Reagan to eat some meals together, as they were staying in the same Covid Ward. Reagan was released from the hospital on 8/21/21 and even though she hates wearing the oxygen cannula, she is VERY happy to be home.            So far, Brian has been out of work for 3.5 weeks and his job does not offer sick pay. He is still in the hospital and we don’t know when he is going to be released. My sister has always been a stay-at-home mom so she can take care of Reagan, who requires lots of special care. Whenever Brian is released, the Dr’s told him he will not be able to return to work right away, as his lungs will need to fully heal. Brian’s job requires him to be on his feet all day and his lungs won’t be able to handle that for some time.            Please consider giving to The Mahoney’s GoFundMe page . Even a small amount will make a HUGE difference to them. They’ve had LOTS of extra expenses during this time and still need to pay their monthly bills without any income for the foreseeable future. Feel free to share this post to your FB page, as every donation will be a tremendous blessing.            Thank you to everyone who’s been praying daily for them! They feel incredibly humbled to know that there’s an army of people praying and interceding on their behalf. We see all of the comments that your leaving on our FB posts, and it’s good to know that people still care.            With much love,      Pia ❤️          8-26-21 Update:    Both Brian and Reagan are at home recovering. Brian has a visiting nurse assist him daily and can walk and stand for about 10 minutes before being completely winded and out of breath. They are both on oxygen all day and night . Dr’s are anticipating a return to work in about another 3-4 weeks for Brian. He works outside in 12 hour shifts doing security work and does not get to sit that often. His lungs have to be completely healed before he can work outside in the Florida heat. When this is all said and done, Brian will have missed about 2 months of pay. That’s financially devastating to anyone, especially a family of four with a special needs child. \\xa0Please consider giving. Any amount will help. Thank you and much love and appreciation to all those who have donated so far! ❤️❤️❤️  ',\n",

We became lifelong friends and he even named his beautiful daughter after me.\\xa0  In June 2020 he was hospitalized with COVID-19 and intubated for 3 months. As a result of that long intubation and his illness, he has had such terrible complications that he hasn’t been able to walk, let alone work. In addition to physical therapy and many hours spent in hyperbaric tanks, he has been diagnosed with tracheal stenosis (his windpipe almost entirely closed).\\xa0 In his town, the medical care has not been top notch and he is now having to travel over 300km and 10,000 meters in elevation to Lima for specialist care.  He had a portion of his trachea removed but it wasn't enough. In January we managed to raise enough money to literally save his life with a second surgery that put a tube into his trachea to help him breathe. The surgery went well and he is recovering slowly back home in Huancayo with his brilliant daughter helping to aspirate the tube and remove the phlegm daily. However, this isn't the end of the road.\\xa0  Armando will need to travel from his home in the Andes down to Lima for imaging, tests, and more procedures to remove the tube and track his progress over the next 6 months. We anticipate there may be another surgery after the tube is removed if the stenosis starts to close off his trachea again.\\xa0\\xa0  Armando is able to work a bit now\\xa0 for the first time since last June. But it just isn't enough with all of the anticipated medical costs. He is going to be in Lima the strong  first week in March /strong  and will need financial support so he can be seen by the specialist.\\xa0  Armando and his daughter are so grateful for your generosity and kindness. I cannot express enough how meaningful and impactful your gift will be. It will save Armando's life. Messages of support are welcome in any languages.  strong No donation is too small to help cover these critical medical expenses.\\xa0  Thank you! Gracias!\\xa0  /strong \",\n",

The year 2020 brought them unthinkable hardships that led them down a long recovery road...both medically and financially.\\xa0  In August 2020, Lidia fell seriously ill and was rushed to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a brain tumor that required urgent surgery due to the size and position of the tumor it caused a myriad of troubling symptoms. At the height of covid she was admitted to Neuro ICU, alone and disoriented, where she underwent  strong two brain operations /strong . Her optic nerve sustained damage so her vision in the left eye has not been the same since. The affected eye has caused her double vision, dizziness and a loss of equilibrium. Her recovery has been hard and strenuous. She has been home bound, unable to work, and still requires caretaker assistance to move room to room. But she continues to be hopeful and positive.  Just a few short months later, in December 2020, Lidia\\'s sole caretaker, her husband, Dan, contracted Covid-19 at work and was later\\xa0 rushed to the hospital in critical condition with an  strong oxygen saturation of 53% /strong . He was admitted to the ICU and stayed on forced oxygen for 3 and a half weeks. Once he was stable, he applied for medical pay only to find out he was unjustly fired from his current construction job. Because of the extensive damage his lungs had sustained from the infection, his employment options are now incredibly limited. Since he was hospitalized at the end of 2020, he has only been able to secure 2 weeks of work.   In just a few short months, their lives were turned upside down. Their medical bills alone are overwhelming. They have a mortgage to pay and a daughter who is attending her first year of university, hoping to become an optometrist one day. She requires medical care as well for her diabetic treatment that she has had since an early age from pancreatitis.

The hospital was testing his lungs and how well he could tolerate movement to be transported to a long term acute care facility in oklahoma city.  They couldn't get transportation for several days.  It actually worked out perfectly because it kept shane close to home and he improved enough that when they tested his lungs, they decided he could recover at home if he had full time assistance.  So Shane is home now with his wife and 2 boys.      However, he has a long road to a full recovery, and at this time karen is unable to work because she has to be with him full time.  She's already missed a lot of work because of having covid herself and then quarantine protocols etc. I'm just hoping we can take some of the financial stress off of them both while Shane focuses on a full recovery.

His condition continued to worson. He ended up on a ventilator for a few weeks. But his fight was far from over. He had been transferred to a high level hospital while he was on the ventilator. He was still having some really really bad days even after the ventilator. In all, from August 8th until yesterday he has been in 4 different hospitals. He was discharged last week but unfortunately after just 1 night he had a lung collapse and was back in the hospital.     \\xa0     Obviously he’s been out of work since August and is now completely unemployed.     Anyone who knows Jeff knows he’s ambitious, hard working and loyal to his employers.     \\xa0     Jeff is one of the “good guys” and would give the shirt off of his back for someone in need. He now faces a very long road to recovery. He is on oxygen full time and walking with the aid of a walker.

       " \"You may know Mark Lopez and his wife Darcy from his many years as Artistic Director at Fright Farm Haunted House or their many other artistic endeavors in local theatre and TV. In early December 2020, despite their careful efforts to avoid being exposed to it, Mark Lopez and his wife Darcy were both diagnosed with COVID-19. Both of them became very sick. Mark became sick enough to be sent to the hospital by ambulance twice in two days.   Mark continued to have more medical complications while at the hospital and eventually had to be placed in a medically-induced coma to allow him to be attached to a ventilator. He was later placed on a feeding tube and needed dialysis.  After a week and a half on a ventilator, Mark finally improved enough to be taken off the ventilator and is now able to breathe on his own with some supplemental support.  Fortunately over the past few days, he has been able to talk to Darcy and their family and start on the long road to recovery. As you may have heard, COVID-19 can potentially have some long-lasting effects and it is unknown how long it will be before Mark and Darcy will be fully recovered.  Mark and Darcy need some financial support during this difficult time. Due to Darcy and Mark's health conditions, they are unable to walk to the community laundry room in their complex. They are specifically planning to purchase a stackable washer and dryer for their apartment. This is expected to cost around $1,500. They also have other financial needs related to Mark's medical care and monthly household expenses because he has been hospitalized since December 21, 2020 and may remain there for some time.  As you know, Mark and Darcy are both very humble and private and are not the kind of people to ask for help from others. If you can contribute anything to this cause, I know they will be greatly appreciative of your support.  (This fundraiser was created by Kevin Davy who is a friend of Mark and Darcy's from the Fright Farm Haunted House days. Darcy has given permission to post this information and she and Mark will receive all of whatever funds are raised after GoFundMe's fees are deducted.)\",\n",

After 13 days of being on the ventilator, and with Rafael’s health declining further, he had to be placed on an ECMO machine which is another form of life support that would replace the function of his lungs, giving his own, time to rest.

       " 'Hello friends and family!  \\xa0 I\\'m sharing this because many of you are concerned about my father Antonios health and well being. On Thursday March 18th my father was informed that he had been in contact with a peer who tested positive for COVID-19 he quickly went to get tested we waited for results, the next day we received his results he tested NEGATIVE we were all relieved not knowing the worse was to come. That following weekend he woke up with body aches, fever, and headaches we thought nothing of it since his results were negative we figured a common cold, Monday morning came along and he had a high temperature of 102.6 that\\'s when things escalated we quickly made an appointment to get him seen by a Dr. he was showing all COVID-19 symptoms so they recommended he get re-tested. Tuesday morning my dad went to the testing site to get re-tested we waited for results, wednesday morning came and we received his results he was indeed POSITIVE.   \\xa0 We followed CDC guidelines and isolated him in his room shortly after our whole family got tested thankfully we all tested negative and till this day we are well in health. We expected him to get worse it was just the start of his quarantine week he was experiencing a lot of headaches,fevers,chills, and a horrible scratchy cough. We tried all home remedies as well as medications his Dr. had prescribed him but nothing seem to work. Second week of his quarantine came along and we still saw no progress he lost his appetite and started declining on Monday March 29th we woke up got his breakfast ready, medications and tea not knowing that behind his closed door he was laying in bed struggling to breathe, my mother knew something was wrong he wasn\\'t answering the door so she quickly double masked and went in his room if at that moment my mother wouldn\\'t have gone in we would\\'ve been too late. She quickly realised he was out of breathe and he was rushed to our local hospital to get treated, it was hard at first to get him to go to the hospital not having medical insurance he was scared to go into debt with all the medical expenses but we were finally able to get him to the hospital.   \\xa0 He is now hospitalized at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido battling COVID-19 Pneumonia, he is undergoing many treatments in order to help his lungs and avoid one or the other to collapse and give up on him. His oxygen levels are dropping. He is getting treated with antibiotics as well as getting a blood transfusion with plasma from previous COVID-19 patients donated from what we have been informed is that the plasma he is getting carries COVID-19 antibodies which can result in rapid improvement at the moment they are not seeing that he is not stable. Many of you know my father Antonio, and know how hard he works he\\'s always provided for his family working 6 days a week, always putting others before himself. Not only is he a great father and husband, but he\\'s an amazing grandfather to his 3 precious grandchildren who terribly miss him. He has dedicated 20 + years of his life working as a Carpenter, once discharged he will have a long road to recovery, and we are hoping the best during these challenging times. Due to the financial struggle we know will occur, we are asking for donations to help my father Antonio. Anything helps as this will be a challenging time on our family as my dad recovers once out of the hospital.

Comparto esto porque muchos de ustedes están preocupados por la salud y el bienestar de mi padre Antonio. El jueves 18 de marzo le informaron a mi padre que había estado en contacto con un compañero que dio positivo en la prueba de COVID-19, rápidamente fue a hacerse la prueba, esperamos los resultados, al día siguiente recibimos sus resultados, dio NEGATIVO, todos nos sentimos aliviados de no sabiendo que lo peor estaba por venir. Ese fin de semana siguiente se despertó con dolores corporales, fiebre y dolores de cabeza, no pensamos nada de eso, ya que sus resultados fueron negativos, calculamos un resfriado común, llegó el lunes por la mañana y tenía una temperatura alta de 102.6, ahí es cuando las cosas se intensificaron rápidamente hicimos una cita para que lo viera un Dr. él estaba mostrando todos los síntomas de COVID-19, por lo que recomendaron que se volviera a hacer la prueba. El martes por la mañana mi papá fue al sitio de la prueba para volver a hacerse la. Esperamos los resultados, llegó el miércoles por la mañana y recibimos sus resultados. Él era realmente POSITIVO.  \\xa0 \\xa0Seguimos las instrucciones del CDC y lo aislamos en su habitación poco después de que toda nuestra familia se hiciera la prueba, afortunadamente todos obtuvimos resultados negativos y hasta el día de hoy estamos bien de salud. Esperábamos que empeorara, era solo el comienzo de su semana de cuarentena, una semana pasó y estaba experimentando muchos dolores de cabeza, fiebre, escalofríos y una tos horrible y rasposa. Probamos todos los remedios caseros, así como los medicamentos que le había recetado su doctor, pero nada parece funcionar. Llegó la segunda semana de su cuarentena y todavía no vimos ningún progreso, perdió el apetito y comenzó a declinar el lunes 29 de marzo, nos despertamos, preparamos el desayuno, los medicamentos y el té sin saber que detrás de la puerta cerrada estaba acostado en la cama luchando por respirar. , mi madre sabía que algo andaba mal, él no estaba respondiendo a la puerta, así que rápidamente se puso su máscara y se fue a su habitación. Si en ese momento mi madre no hubiera entrado, habríamos llegado demasiado tarde. Rápidamente se dio cuenta de que estaba sin aliento y lo llevaron de urgencia a nuestro hospital local para recibir tratamiento, al principio fue difícil conseguir que fuera al hospital sin seguro médico, tenía miedo de endeudarse con todos los gastos médicos, pero finalmente logramos llevarlo al hospital. \\xa0 \\xa0 Ahora se encuentra hospitalizado en Palomar Medical Center en Escondido luchando contra la neumonía COVID-19, se está sometiendo a muchos tratamientos para ayudar a sus pulmones y evitar que uno u otro colapse y se rinda con él. Sus niveles de oxígeno están cayendo. Está recibiendo tratamiento con antibióticos, además de recibir una transfusión de sangre con plasma de pacientes anteriores de COVID-19 donados de lo que nos han informado es que el plasma que está recibiendo contiene anticuerpos COVID-19 que pueden resultar a ayudarlo a mejorar más rápidamente. En el momento no ven que el tratamiento de plasma lo esté ayudando a estar estable. Muchos de ustedes conocen a mi padre Antonio, y saben lo duro que trabaja, siempre se ha ocupado de su familia trabajando 6 días a la semana, siempre anteponiendo a los demás a sí mismo. No solo es un gran padre y esposo, sino que también es un abuelo increíble para sus 3 preciosos nietos que lo extrañan terriblemente. Ha dedicado más de 20 años de su vida a trabajar como carpintero, una vez dado de alta tendrá un largo camino hacia la recuperación, y esperamos lo mejor durante estos tiempos desafiantes. Debido a la lucha financiera que sabemos que ocurrirá, estamos solicitando donaciones para ayudar a mi padre Antonio. Cualquier cosa ayuda, ya que será un momento difícil para nuestra familia, ya que mi padre se recuperará una vez que salga del hospital.

Presently, the hospital bill has past $20,000 USD and they do not accept his insurance!   We are\\xa0 extremely uncomfortable with the cost at this current hospital that does not accept any payment plans nor insurance and have already spoken with attorneys in the field.

We plan to transfer him to the new hospital no later than the end of this week and therefore are reaching out for any and all assistance that is available.

Actualmente está siendo atendido en un hospital en Tepic, México, pero estamos planeando transferirlo a Guadalajara, México inmediatamente. ¡Actualmente, la factura del hospital ha superado los $ 20,000 USD y no aceptan su seguro!  Estamos extremadamente incómodos con el costo en este hospital actual que no acepta ningún plan de pago ni seguro y ya hemos hablado con abogados en el campo. Hemos podido inscribirlo en un nuevo plan de seguro complementario y hemos rastreado un hospital que permitirá su nuevo seguro ya que no podemos cumplir con la demanda del costo diario en el hospital actual. Planeamos transferirlo al nuevo hospital a más tardar al final de esta semana y, por lo tanto, estamos buscando toda la asistencia disponible.  Los hospitales en México son notoriamente conocidos por mantener a sus pacientes como rehenes hasta que su factura médica se pague por completo y esperamos que esta no sea la situación que soportaremos. Oramos y esperamos que todo salga bien. Creemos firmemente que Jesus Cristo es sanador y moverá los corazones de los demás para ayudar a mi abuelo.

The sibling that passed has left behind a wife and three young children, who are now responsible for over $10K in medical expenses, along with dealing with such a sudden and tragic loss. The dollars raised through this fundraiser will go to their family to help with these costs.          We're asking our community to come together to please help out the family of this community member, as they have continuously and generously stepped up to help so many of our most vulnerable families at Atkinson over the years, and we would like to take this opportunity to give back.         Thank you for your support!            \",\n",

       " '  Hi, my name is Hannah and I’m fundraising for Dave.  Dave is an over the road truck driver who came down with Covid-19 and had to be hospitalized. He’s been on a ventilator in ICU for nearly a week and they just put him on ECMO to help him heal better. We expect him to stay in ICU for 3-4 weeks and then he’ll have a long road to recovery and normal life involving a lot of physical therapy and follow up appointments. David is an independent contractor through his job and doesn’t have health insurance, so this is going to be an expensive time of life, he won’t be able to start driving again for a while.

       " \"My name is Brenda and I'm raising needed funds for my brother, Scott, and his 2 children; Taylor 13, and Brianna 9. Their wife/mom left them abruptly 3 yrs ago, and Scott has full custody of the kids. \\xa0Besides the shock and emotional trauma, it's been financially devastating as Scott was in-between jobs at the time. Family and friends have stepped up, but now we need more help and resources.  GOAL: \\xa0TO KEEP THIS DEAR FAMILY FROM BECOMING HOMELESS  SCOTT: \\xa0 A wonderful father and loved deeply by the kids. We didn't have a father growing up, thus Scott is highly determined to 'be there' for his children and provide the love and security they need. He is resourceful and has sold what he can. Being an older father (54), the jobs are harder to find but Scott never gives up, and keeps putting out resumes. I became involved after witnessing him trying everything possible to stay afloat.  KIDS: \\xa0Both very bright and tender hearted. Wonderful helpers around the house. Sensitive and caring - great kids. They have long talks to help each other through the trauma of losing their mom. Both are mature beyond their years. Taylor has autism which poses extra concerns for Scott, seeing the money isn't there to help him. Taylor is now falling behind in school.  PAST 3 YRS: \\xa0Life has been quite difficult with sporadic income and deciding what \\xa0bills to pay. This family has had one hardship after another and just wants to be able to move forward and heal together. In September 2020, Scott found 3 part-time consulting jobs and was starting to see a positive shift for the first time in a long time. He was excited to be able to provide once again and gain stability. This was short lived.  ENTER COVID: \\xa0Early Oct. all 3 contracted Covid-19 and needed to be hospitalized. The kids were admitted, but Scott stayed at home (in great pain), knowing he couldn't pay hospital bills. As the kids improved, Scott got worse. At one point, I thought we'd lose him. The kids went to foster homes until Scott tested negative...they were apart for 5 weeks. Shortly after they were back together, Scott fell down their stairs due to being weak and having full body pain...not being able to grasp the railing. His Covid symptoms left him feeling like he has severe arthritis all over. His hands are the worst and he can hardly use them. The doctor calls it 'Covid hands'. From the fall, he got a concussion and had severe spine damage, needing immediate surgery. He explained he couldn't afford it and stayed home on the couch for 23 days in tears, because the pain was so bad. Family helped with the initial expense for his back surgery and that took place on Nov. 23. Afraid they would lose their dad, the kids slept on the floor in front of the couch for some time. \\xa0They were the best little servants.  Covid has cost Scott one of his jobs. His symptoms were in a severe state for 9 weeks, and while he still has them, they have lessened to a more tolerable state. His doctors say the Covid after effects could linger for some time. Brianna's symptoms came back and she was hospitalized for 5 more days; currently recovering with good and bad days.  MENTAL STATES: \\xa0They are mentally and physically exhausted, especially Scott. Three years of high stress and balancing acts have taken their toll on them. Always putting out fires has left no time to heal from their original loss of a wife and mother.  WHAT'S NEEDED: \\xa0HELP WITH HOSPITAL BILLS and REGULAR MONTHLY BILLS to stay afloat until Scott can find more work, once he's feeling better. His current income is NOT covering bills.  We are asking those who are able and have the means, to please consider encouraging Scott and the kids in this way. Anything we can do to lessen the burdens, is needed. He's been humbled and extremely grateful for all the help so far, and prays for strength to keep going mentally to keep his family together. We've watched him endure much and want to see him succeed, keep the faith, and know there are better days ahead. The kids have often taken on worrying about the finances, feeling guilty for going into the hospital. Their little minds shouldn't have such concerns.  Please consider how you can help. We also welcome your prayers for this family. THANK YOU very much for your consideration and for allowing me to share this need.\",\n",

She would never tell me how much money the bills for her and her father have cost her, but I assume they reach well into five figures. Medical debt is difficult for everyone, but it's especially devastating for immigrants like Suzy, who often have to support multiple generations of their families.  I don't know how time-sensitive her bills are, so I'd like to have a check for her by July.  When I first started working with Suzy, she was recovering from another hospitalization after being dragged under a moving car. She has overcome more than most of us could possibly imagine. She has a large family, all of whom she regularly brings to the shop, including her father (who consistently played ABBA videos on the TV) and her granddaughter (born just last year). That's four generations of one family, always around to support each other.  Suzy told me she's feeling better and that she's excited to come back to work, and that she's still praying for her father. She said the company is like her second home and her co-workers like her second family.\\xa0  So let's do what a family does. Let's show her we care.\",\n",

       " '  Hi my name is Emerald and I\\'m fundraising for my husband Sean \"Deano\" Yerton. He was hospitalized August 16th 2021 with covid and covid complications. He has survived double pneumonia, two infections, oxygen dependency, he was placed on the vent for a month in September 2021 and was on the trach for another month in October 2021. He survived a stroke as well in October 2021. He has been to two different hospitals and two different rehabs. He is on track to discharge home January 10th. However he is discharging with limited mobility and will be handicapped in a wheelchair/hospital bed. He is dependentX two people which means that it normally takes two people to care for him daily. I will be his main caregiver. He does have insurance but the deductible restarted this year. And as you know it is very expensive to provide home health care and most medical needs/supplies will be out of pocket. If we elect for home health care it is $25 per hour for a caregiver. 12 to 39 hours of caregiving would equal at least $1,000 or more per week. I work a full-time job but there is no way on just my income that I will be able to afford bills, his medical needs out of pocket and medical assistance. I\\'m asking for any help people feel like giving. Whatever is raised will go towards his medical expenses, medical supplies, and home Care. We are very thankful to have him still here with us. And I am determined to provide him with the best care now that he will be home. I have added a total to be raised $4,000 as a cushion to get us started for a month. I don\\'t expect to raise that much but will appreciate anything.         Thank you very much.  ',\n",

While in recovery, Hector’s legs began to turn purple, prompting several visits to the ER. After several tests, they detected that Hector’s legs had little to no circulation due to blood coagulating and not allowing for sufficient circulation to his feet.     \\xa0     Several weeks went by as the Doctors tried to do everything in their power and see if Hector would get better.

I am a Covid survivor.  I know that there are more survivors out there and I am glad to be one of those few.  But I am writing this because I was hit with Covid on November 14, 2021.  I tried to self-medicate and ended up having a temperature of 103.7.  I was in fear of my temperature and decided to check myself into the hospital on November 21, 2021, and right then and there I was told I was Covid positive and that my oxygen level was at 32% and if I had not checked myself into the hospital, I would've been dead in another day or two.  I ended up being hospitalized for just under two months.  I was fired from my job for having Covid, I had to sell a few of my things while in the hospital, just to try and make ends meet so my daughters would not be kicked out of my apartment.  The unemployment office won't help me with benefits because I can't work.  Covid severely damaged my lungs and I must be dependent on oxygen now.  So until I can do my therapy and help heal my lungs, I will not be able to work and neither will unemployment pay off my benefits because according to them, I am not willing to work due to personal illness. I am just trying to get money together for the medications I so desperately need. As well as a few essential items. Because I have not been able to get the medication I need, my health has somewhat taken a turn for the worst. Thank you in advance for the help. Every little bit is appreciated.\\xa0  \",\n",

She and her husband, Charles Cottrell, had both fought through days-long high fevers and painful symptoms of coronavirus when Michelle's oxygen levels plummeted and Charles took her to be admitted to INOVA Fair Oaks on their 15th wedding anniversary. Michelle was in the fight of her life: she was experiencing a a worsening of her diabetic condition, major heart event (myocardial infarction), near kidney failure, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was given excellent care during her stay through many close calls, including another plunge in her oxygen levels that landed her in the PCU. She was finally released after 17 days in the hospital on January 27, 2022.         Michelle now faces a long recovery: doctors estimate that it will take her over a year to gain back functionality like normal movement and cognition, though there is much unknown about long term recovery from COVID-19. The the impact on her health will most likely be permanent, with many elements taking years to approach her pre-virus levels of functionality. Her family also faces mounting hospital bills and the burden of expenses necessary for her health that simply did not exist in their budget before this tragedy.         Her friends and family are asking you to donate what you can to help us reach our goal to aide Michelle in her recovery. She is an incredible educator who has devoted her life towards giving her students the best opportunity to thrive in a challenging world. She has seen her family through medical events, financial challenges, and heartbreak; from her mother's stroke recovery for over ten years to supporting her sisters through housing and child care when she could. As a friend, she is a life long companion who will drop everything to comfort and aide you through difficult times or to share your joy in the good.         Please give what you can, every amount matters. What you donate will go towards Michelle's hospital bills, medications, medical equipment, and expenses related to her recovery.   \",\n",

Drew, our beloved son and a dear friend to many, has been battling Covid-19 since late March and has been hospitalized since April 1st, 2020. He has fought a good fight along with the wonderful staff at Advent Health Orlando and it is truly a miracle he is alive. He still has a long road to recovery.\\xa0  In his battle against Covid-19, he has come close to losing his life against this  terrible virus. The virus has ravaged his lungs and his body several times over. His left\\xa0lung has serious damage and it will be awhile before his lungs heal. He is going to need extensive recovery and rehabilitation therapy once he gets out of the  hospital.\\xa0  strong What Drew has been through: /strong    strong The beginning /strong :  Drew started showing symptoms of Covid 19 on March 22. He was really sick  with all the advertised symptoms and several that they had not discovered yet.  On April 1 after not having a fever for two days he woke up and called me that he was scared because he was having difficulty breathing. He called 911. That was  the last time I heard my son’s voice until just a week ago. We were terrified.\\xa0   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48653430_15917326659140_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48653430_15917326659140_r.jpeg\"     /    strong The next two weeks: /strong  He developed ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypoxemia, where there is not enough oxygen in your blood. The first two weeks he was put into a  medically induced coma and placed on a ventilator. He was then placed on an  ECMO machine as he wasn’t improving. The hospital he is at, thankfully, offers  ECMO, which oxygenates the blood and puts it back in the body. This procedure  saved his life. We got lucky that Drew got taken to AdventHealth Orlando.      img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48653430_1591735608863864_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48653430_1591735608863864_r.jpeg\"     /    strong Weeks 3 and 4: /strong   After 3 weeks they extubated him (took him off the vent) and started prepping  him to come off ECMO.

Six days later in the middle of the night we got a phone call  that he was in multi-organ failure, his left lung was bleeding internally and filling  up with blood. They said he was dying and they prepared us for a final FaceTime  visit because we were not allowed to come to the hospital. I yelled at the doctor  to do surgery to remove his lung if that was what was killing him. She said that  wasn’t an option. So we waited. We were numb and in disbelief. Two hours later  they called to say Drew rallied and they saved him. He was re-intubated (put back on the vent) for a second time. \\xa0   strong Week 5:\\xa0 /strong   Medically induced coma so his lungs could rest  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48653430_159173486653620_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48653430_159173486653620_r.jpeg\"     /   strong Weeks 6 and 7: /strong  He came off the ECMO 16 days later.

My life long friend has been through hell. Truly a miracle that he is with us. His battles are far from over. The strongest guy I know was decimated. His strength, courage, and most importantly his love of family and life is why he is with us today.  Tom is employed on a contract basis. If he cannot work he is not paid.  Tom works in Manhattan and lives in Schuylerville, NY. After being sent out of NYC on March 11 to work from home, Tom began to experience symptoms of Covid 19. Over the next several weeks Toms symptoms would fluctuate in severity. He just wasn’t able to shake them - the cough, the fever, body aches. He tried several times to get tested but early on tests were only available to the very sick/ hospitalized. After a very difficult week at home with a fever, muscle and head aches and swollen lymph nodes in his neck, Tom was admitted to Saratoga hospital on April 18th. His condition worsened overnight and he was placed on a ventilator at 6 am on Sunday April 19. The next ten days he was in a fight for his life. Covid 19 had attacked and weakened his body so severely that he now battled a bacterial infection that threatened to shut down his kidneys,liver and gall bladder. The first week in ICU the doctors fought to control the infection that ravaged his body. We almost lost Tom that week.  By the grace of God, the doctors were able to get the infection under control. However, his kidneys had stopped working and he was placed on dialysis; his gall bladder was so compromised that it will need to be removed. Tom was taken off the ventilator on Sunday May 3rd. His body was so profoundly weakened from his two weeks on the ventilator that he could barely lift his arms or legs. Another 10 days in the hospital (5 in ICU) and Tom was able to leave Saratoga Hospital. It was a miracle! And yet his battle is far from over. As Tom works to regain his strength from home there are still hurdles he will need to overcome. He has numerous doctor visits to follow up on his recovery. He will need to prepare both mentally and physically for a necessary surgery to remove his gall bladder.',\n",

       " '  I contracted COVID-Pneumonia in July, 2020. I had an existing respiratory disease (COPD) and COVID hit my lungs and heart especially hard. I’ve been on high-flow oxygen 24/7 since I was hospitalized with the virus. I now require a specialized portable oxygen concentrator - a rechargeable unit that generates its own oxygen - to safely leave the house for necessary medical appointments. Standard oxygen tanks can be very clumsy and hard to maneuver. They can be unsafe for people like myself who have balance or mobility issues. Also, they do not permit a person who’s oxygen dependent to leave the house for more than a couple of hours at a time. This is very limiting.         I wanted to sincerely thank everyone for considering making a donation towards the purchase of my new oxygen equipment. My goal in life is always to serve others and to make a positive impact. It’s a new experience for me to ask for assistance in anyway. If you’re unable to help then please say a prayer for all COVID patients and Long Haulers. In closing, the unit that I will be purchasing is the OxLife Independence Portable Oxygen Concentrator Bundle (Continuous Flow &amp; Pulse Dose). I also will be purchasing an additional battery and charging station.  ',\n",
       " '   strong ENGLISH /strong   Hello dear friends, family, and all the kind people who have reached this page to read the story of our loving father, Luis Naranjo.  Our family consists of 6 members: our parents Carmen and Luis, and their children Adrian, Priscila, Alvaro, and Paola.  Adrian and Priscila have their own small families, with two young sons each.  Our father has always been very loving, responsible, and committed. He arrived in the United States over 30 years ago and has not stopped working ever since to help provide care and support for his family.  Due to the economic crises that our country was subjected to in the 80s and 90s, our father was forced to emigrate from Ecuador to the city of New York in search of a better life and in pursuit of the American dream. Our mother would join him a few years later. We were separated for over 15 years before finally being reunited and having the opportunity to live together in the United States.  Our father has worked endlessly in various occupations, however, for the past 20 years, he has been a small business owner in the heart of Manhattan located in the Diamond District. He has a small jewelry company where jewelry is beautifully crafted before being displayed throughout stores on 5th Avenue.  Our father’s business, F&amp;N Jewelry Corporation, employs between 7 to 12 people depending on the commercial season.\\xa0  In the second week of March, our father began developing symptoms, high fever and body aches, that at the time we all believed to be the flu. At the same time, our parents and sister Paola, who lives with them, began taking precautions and self-isolated in their shared apartment.  Unfortunately, his symptoms worsened and his fever did not decline for several days, he had no appetite and had developed a persistent cough. My sisters took immediate action and called all the available authorized numbers seeking help and guidance. On March 19th, my sister Paola took our father to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was kept overnight. He was discharged the next morning with a positive test result for COVID-19 with developed pneumonia, he was ordered to self-quarantine, take Tylenol and consistently drink fluids.  By Sunday, March 22th, his condition declined, with his cough worsening and having extreme difficulty breathing, Paola inevitably rushed him back to the hospital for the second time. Late that afternoon we would receive one of the worst news. The hospital had called our sister Priscila to communicate that our father was rushed to the ICU with a collapsed right lung and had to be intubated with a ventilator.  Ever since that night, even to this day, our entire family gathers together for a video call to pray for his recovery as well as the health and safety of all patients, nurses, doctors, and all those who are risking their own lives to fight against this terrible virus.\\xa0  Our father was in the ICU and on the ventilator for 14 days, receiving the best care at Mount Sinai Hospital where he was included in a clinical trial where he would receive an experimental stem cell therapy. Although we might never know if the stem cell treatment helped in his recovery, we are certain that his will to live and strength to fight helped him prevail, be extubated, and removed from the ICU.  On April 10th, after being hospitalized for a total of 21 days, our father was discharged and was able to return home.  Our father, today, finds himself home next to our mother and Paola, being informed by the doctors that he awaits a slow recovery for the next 6 to 8 months until his physical health can improve.  During the time he was in the hospital, and similarly to hundreds of thousands of small businesses, we were not able to acquire any financial loan, grant, or help from the United States Government.  On average, the monthly operating expenses of our parents business totals $25,576.53 of which is distributed primarily to payroll (69%, 7 employees), rent (14.5%), and the remaining payable accounts such as basic services, suppliers, credit line, etc (16.5%).  None of these bills have been paid, and given the non-essential nature of the business, the company has been non-operating as imposed by the Governor of New York.  For this reason, we are reaching out to our friends to seek your generosity and to raise $25,000 that would help tremendously to our father’s business as well as provide overdue relief to his employees and their families.  Thank you so much for your time, undivided attention, and generosity.     \\xa0     \\xa0      strong SPANISH /strong    Hola queridos amigos, familiares y todas las amables personas que han llegado hasta aquí a leer la historia de nuestro querido padre Luis Naranjo.   En nuestra familia somos 6 miembros: nuestros padres Carmen y Luis y sus hijos Adrián, Priscila, Alvaro y Paola.\\xa0  Adrián y Priscila tenemos nuestra pequeña familia con dos hijos cada uno.\\xa0  Nuestro padre es muy amoroso, responsable y comprometido. Llegó a Estados Unidos hace mas de 30 años y desde entonces no ha parado de trabajar para cuidar y sacar adelante a su familia como lo ha hecho hasta ahora.   Por las crisis económicas nuestro padre y unos años después nuestra madre se vieron obligados a emigrar del Ecuador hacia la ciudad de Nueva York y nos separamos por mas de 15 años, luego de todo ese tiempo felizmente pudimos reencontrarnos y vivir todos juntos en Estados Unidos.   Nuestro papá ha trabajado incansablemente en muchos lugares pero desde hace 20 años es el dueño de un pequeño negocio en el corazón de Manhattan, en el distrito del diamante. Su negocio es un taller de joyería donde se realizan bellas joyas que adornan las tiendas de la 5ta avenida.\\xa0  En el negocio de mi padre, F&amp;N Jewelry Corporation, colaboran entre 7 y 12 personas dependiendo de la temporada comercial, es un pequeño negocio familiar.  La segunda semana de Marzo nuestro padre inició a desarrollar síntomas de lo que pensamos era una gripe, tenía fiebre y malestar general del cuerpo. Al mismo tiempo iniciaron las medidas de distanciamiento social por lo que mis padres y Paola, quienes viven juntos, guardaron aislamiento en casa.\\xa0  Los síntomas\\xa0 empeoraron, la fiebre no bajó en varios días, su apetito desapareció e inició un cuadro de tos. Mis hermanas actuaron rápidamente, llamaron a los números autorizados y Paola llevó a mi padre al hospital el 19 de Marzo donde pasó la noche, al día siguiente fue dado de alta con la noticia de que sus exámenes dieron positivo para Coronavirus y que debía permanecer aislado, tomar Tylenol y beber muchos líquidos.\\xa0  Para el día Domingo 22 de Marzo su condición empeoró, tenía mas tos y se dificultaba su respiración, nuevamente Paola llevó a nuestro padre al hospital. Mas tarde ese día tendríamos una mala noticia. Llamaron a Priscila del Hospital para indicarnos que ingresarían a papá a una unidad de cuidados intensivos y lo intubarían en un respirador.\\xa0  Desde esa noche hasta el día de hoy nos reunimos todas las noches en videollamada para rezar por él y ahora también por la salud y seguridad de pacientes, enfermeros, doctores y todos quienes se arriesgan para luchar contra esta terrible enfermedad.   Nuestro padre estuvo en una unidad de cuidados intensivos por 14 días, recibió el mejor cuidado en el Hospital Monte Sinaí de la ciudad de Nueva York y pudo ser incluido en un estudio clínico y recibir un tratamiento experimental de células madre. Aunque no sabremos si el tratamiento le ayudó en su recuperación sabemos que su fortaleza, ganas de luchar y vivir intensamente le permitió resistir, ser extubado y salir de la unidad de cuidados intensivos.   El día 10 de Abril, después de estar hospitalizado por un total de 21 días nuestro padre fue dado de alta y regresó a casa.\\xa0  Nuestro papá ahora descansa en casa junto con nuestra mamá y Paola, los doctores nos comunicaron que le espera una lenta recuperación por los próximos 6 a 8 meses hasta poder mejorar sus capacidades físicas nuevamente.\\xa0  Durante el tiempo que él estuvo en el hospital, y así como miles de pequeños negocios, no pudimos acceder al paquete de estímulos impulsado por el gobierno de Estados Unidos para este tipo de empresas.\\xa0  El negocio de mi padre en promedio de los últimos meses costó operar mensualmente\\xa0 $ 25,576.53\\xa0 que se distribuyen principalmente en el rol de pagos 69% (7 colaboradores), renta 14.5%\\xa0 y otras cuentas como servicios básicos, proveedores, línea de crédito, etc 16.5%.\\xa0  Ninguno de estos rubros han sido pagados y el negocio al no ser considerado esencial no está dentro de los negocios programados para ser abiertos en el estado de New York\\xa0 según ha dicho el gobernador.\\xa0   Es por esta razón que estamos acudiendo a ustedes queridos amigos para apelar a su generosidad y poder recolectar la cantidad de $ 25,000 que ayude al negocio de nuestro padre y brinde alivio a las familias de sus colaboradores.   El dinero que logremos recolectar de sus generosas donaciones será distribuido en la misma proporción de los costos de operar el negocio de nuestro padre.

       " '  The coronavirus has changed the life of my brother Frank Gomez Jr.  he contracted COVID-19 in January and was hospitalized on January 18, 2021. He has laid unconscious, heavily sedated in the intensive care unit at Round Rock Medical Center for over 4 months. Where a mechanical ventilator would pump oxygen into his lungs, which have been destroyed by the virus. With updates from the nurses we were told he had a slim chance to none of survival. Upon phone calls and surviving on an up-and-down roller coaster not knowing from one hour to the next if he was going to survive, the doctors with Gods grace decided to take the last chance they had to try to give him a tracheotomy, which is an incision on the anterior aspect of the neck, opening a direct airway or as a site for a tracheal tube, in hopes that this would relieve the pressure in his lungs. I am thankful to say my brother has survived. After he was released from the hospital he endured 2 more months of physical and speech therapy to learn how to walk, eat, smile and talk again and the things we take for granted. His employer continue pushing him to hurry and get well so that he could get off of FMLA disability and he was told he could go back to light duty,  after being medically released he had informed his employer that he was ready to go back to work he was told, not knowing the second he returned to his longtime job of 21 years they would lay him off.  With no way to support himself and his family he applied for unemployment. He was told by TWC that his identity has been stolen and someone else was already getting his unemployment benefits so he would not be eligible to receive benefits until the investigation has been complete, there is no telling how long this may take. So his unfortunate circumstances continued to get worse. He has since lost his vehicle mode of  transportation and has had to make arrangements to try not to lose his home. What does he do now… He’s gone through so many hurdles to survive this journey, this is just another big disappointment. I am asking you if you can please help him to get back on his feet, with the vehicle to look for a job, and help him to catch up on his mortgage and utilities, while he is steadily gaining his strength and stamina to look for employment elsewhere. Everyone that knows my brother Frank can honestly say he’s a hard worker and he’s a great loving person to whoever he meets. Thank you for all your Prayers, Love and Support.  ',\n",

Her husband Martin had been hospitalized in ICU a day earlier.\\xa0 Little did she know her battle was just beginning. \"Marthita\" as she is known, developed many complications as COVID was wreaking havoc on her immune system. She came down with pneumonia infections, kidney failure and went into septic shock. The entire hospital stay was an emotional rollercoaster for her and her family. There were days where she seemed to be recovering and days the doctors would not give any hope.  After seven months, Marthita was discharged from the hospital on April 5, 2021 as soon as she was able to breathe on her own. The hospital is overcrowded and lacks personnel due to COVID. Due to the long duration of her hospitalization, my dear cousin developed a serious bed sore and doctors informed the family that she needs surgery to close the wound, but she has been put on waiting list for this procedure due to the lack of resources and space in the surgery unit.  As Marthita waits for her surgery intervention, she requires special care at her home since she is not able to walk and can hardly speak without getting fatigued. Her family cannot afford a caregiver, medical supervision, rehabilitation and medical supplies. Her husband\\'s income can only go so far and barely supports the household as it is, let alone be enough to cover the additional medical expenses. Her 16-year-old daughter is trying to help in between school work and her oldest daughter is baking goods after her regular job to raise money.\\xa0   Who is Marthita? My cousin is someone who loves life and a person who has always tried to help others.\\xa0\\xa0 She has the heart of an angel and this is why I humbly ask all family and friends to help me raise funds for her to get the care she needs at home while she waits her turn for surgery and during the long way to recovery that most likely will require months. \\xa0\\xa0Her family and I will always be grateful.  -------------------------------------\\xa0 Spanish version  Mi prima, Martha Barria, fue ingresada en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI) del hospital Edgardo Rebagliati en Lima, Perú, el 18 de septiembre de 2020 y conectada a un respirador inmediatamente. Su esposo Martin había sido hospitalizado en la UCI un día antes.\\xa0 Poco sabía mi prima que su batalla apenas comenzaba. \"Marthita\", como se la conoce, desarrolló muchas complicaciones ya que el COVID estaba causando estragos en su sistema inmunológico. Desarrollo infecciones por neumonía, insuficiencia renal y entró en shock séptico. Toda la permanencia en el hospital fue como una montaña rusa de emociones para ella y su familia. Hubo días en los que parecía estar recuperándose y días en que los médicos no daban ninguna esperanza.   Después de siete meses, Marthita fue dada de alta del hospital el 5 de abril de 2021 tan pronto como pudo respirar por su cuenta. Hay una situación de hacinamiento en el hospital actualmente y este carece de personal debido al COVID. Como consecuencia de la larga duración de su hospitalización, mi querida prima desarrolló una llaga grave que los médicos determinaron requiere de cirugía para cerrar la herida. Actualmente se encuentra en lista de espera para este procedimiento debido a la falta de recursos y espacio en la unidad de cirugía del hospital.   Mientras Marthita espera su intervención quirúrgica, requiere de cuidados especiales en su casa ya que no está en capacidad de caminar y apenas si puede hablar sin fatigarse. Su familia no tiene capacidad económica para pagar una enfermera en casa, supervisión médica, rehabilitación y suministros médicos. Los ingresos de su esposo sólo cubren los gastos básicos del hogar. Su hija de 16 años está tratando de ayudar entre el trabajo escolar y su hija mayor está horneando productos después de su trabajo regular para recaudar dinero para los gastos médicos que deben solventar.\\xa0   ¿Quién es Marthita? Mi prima es alguien que ama la vida y una persona que siempre ha tratado de ayudar a los demás.\\xa0\\xa0 Ella tiene el corazón de un ángel y es por eso que humildemente pido a toda la familia y amigos que me ayuden a recaudar fondos para que reciba la atención que necesita en casa mientras espera su turno para la cirugía y durante el largo camino a la recuperación que muy probablemente requerirá meses.\\xa0\\xa0 Su familia y yo siempre estaremos agradecidos.',\n",

       " '   One of our very own, Julie Zugenbuehler, a Nurse for 39 years.\\xa0 32 years she served patients in the PACU. Julie contracted COVID-19 at the end of June, most likely at work caring for her patients. She was hospitalized for 8 days in July. Her condition was so bad at one point that while she was hospitalized in the intensive care unit she could not talk, and had to ask for help from HR to call the short term disability office every day to report her which was hard to find.  In PACU, caring for her patients, Julie was unable to socially distance from her patients. Her role as their nurse was to support and maintain her patient\\'s airways which often meant she was within arms reach encouraging them to cough and breathe deeply- all while the patient was unmasked. She had reservations re-wearing her single-use surgical mask for weeks on end, but Julie took the PPE and precautions seriously. She donned her surgical mask, face shield, and gloves with every patient. She frequently washed her hands while providing care to her patients. She socially isolated outside of work. Yet, she still contracted COVID-19. Furthermore, because her patients were predominantly outpatient, there was no clear patient to connect her infection to so the hospital denied her COVID pay. \\xa0 Since her discharge home from the hospital, she is still requiring oxygen. She reports struggling with many lingering symptoms that are often categorized with the catch-all term of \"brain fog.\" Symptoms such as extreme fatigue, cognitive changes, vertigo, and chronic shortness of breath have made her day to day life more difficult than she could imagine, it makes simply taking care of herself a challenge. She has new symptoms pop up, and then disappear, only to return again. She has seen multiple specialists, none of whom know how to help her regain her independence and control over her life.   She said she was discharge from the hospital she has dedicated 39 years of her life to as a COVID survivor, but she does not feel like a survivor and she does not feel supported.  \"I feel hospitals have a moral obligation to their own Health care workers who put their life on the line during the pandemic.\"  Because of the sequelae of her illness she is unable to work and has gone into a medically required retirement. She has no income which has caused her continued stress, all while trying to allow her body to heal. She has applied for long term disability as her short term disability has been extended twice and will eventually run out. She has\\xa0 been denied long term disability because they do not have Disability for “Long COVID,” with the excuse being “It’s too new.” She was denied workers comp on the same day she applied for it. After all of these complications and minimal assistance to navigate how to get help, she feels alienated and that she didn\\'t receive support from her hospital  Julie has such uncertainty with her future, and finances are clearly one of them with her continued denial of long term disability, she was notified her insurance had expired, and is now on a payment plan for her health care costs, and is paying $900.00 monthly for COBRA insurance. All of this is due to the care she provided as a nurse during a pandemic.   She never expected her long career in the work that she loves to end this way, and it is clear that neither did any of us. In a true act of love, compassion, and support we as a group of nurses are choosing to support Julie in the ways our hospital has failed her. We want to honor her for all that she has done over her 39 years of dedication to patients and fellow nurses. We want to show Julie that we as nurses care for her. So, chip in as little or as much as you can, we would like to help reduce her financial burden so she can focus on healing and not on how to pay her bills.  \"Individually we are a drop, but together we are an ocean.\"   ',\n",

My father Juan Alonso was a healthy and strong man his whole life with no underlying conditions and without any health problems. He has worked and supported our family as the sole provider. He was especially hit hard last year due to Covid-19 and was hospitalized in June 2020 and intubated a few weeks later. My father was in a coma for 4 months.\\xa0 Doctors gave us no hope and kept telling us he had no chances of surviving. Our family decided to keep him intubated and on life support, while we prayed and asked the doctors to do anything and everything to save my fathers life.\\xa0 Our prayers were answered and my dad woke up in October 2020 and discharged in February 2021 with a tracheostomy and hooked up to oxygen. He depends on oxygen to do any type of physical activity due to this he is unable to work. We have been helping him financially but it is challenging at times, and this is why we are asking for your help to help our father in these challenging times. He is a Covid survivor and we could use your help we will appreciate it and be so grateful for any amount that you can donate. THANK YOU\\xa0    El año 2020 nos golpeó duramente a todos y ha impactado la mayor parte de nuestras vidas. Mi padre Juan Alonso fue un hombre sano y fuerte toda su vida sin condiciones subyacentes y sin ningún problema de salud. Ha trabajado y apoyado a nuestra familia como único proveedor. Fue especialmente golpeado el año pasado debido a Covid-19 y fue hospitalizado en junio de 2020 e intubado unas semanas más tarde. Mi padre estuvo en coma durante 4 meses. Los médicos no nos dieron esperanza y nos dijeron que no tenía posibilidades de sobrevivir. Nuestra familia decidió mantenerlo intubado y con soporte vital, mientras orábamos y pedíamos a los médicos que hicieran cualquier cosa y todo para salvar la vida de mis padre. Nuestras oraciones fueron contestadas y mi padre se despertó en octubre de 2020 y fue dado de alta en febrero de 2021 con una traqueotomía y conectado al oxígeno. Depende del oxígeno para hacer cualquier tipo de actividad física debido a esto es incapaz de trabajar. Lo hemos estado ayudando económicamente, pero a veces es un reto, y es por eso que estamos pidiendo su ayuda para ayudar a nuestro padre en estos tiempos difíciles. Él es un sobreviviente de Covid y podríamos usar su ayuda lo apreciaremos y estaremos muy agradecidos por cualquier cantidad que pueda donar. Gracias',\n",

It was not an easy battle but God is good--we all got healed.  Unfortunately, my family in the Philippines got the virus as well.  Early April, my mom, dad and brother were all infected by COVID 19. My brother, Joselito, was the one who got infected first. He got it from work and unfortunately gave to our parents.\\xa0  Sadly, my brother joined our creator last April 23rd.

My mother already has given up saying that my father is already gone.\\xa0  My two remaining brothers and I, while still grieving the sudden  death of our brother, are now also faced with the mounting  hospital bills of our parents. Even before our parents got COVID, my father was initially hospitalized for a mild stroke while our  mother was treated for her sudden insulin drop and spine surgery. All these things have happened in a span of about a month.\\xa0 We were able to\\xa0 manage the bills as a family and with the help of  those who are near us, but the bills brought about by the current  hospitalization is now putting so much strain on each of us.\\xa0\\xa0  Today, we humbly ask for your prayers and assistance and will  greatly appreciate any help that you can extend to us.

After a three week stay at DayKimball hospital; she was life flighted to Yale New Haven Hospital where she is now receiving specialized care in their ICU unit; where she remains in stable but critical condition. This fund is geared to to assist her husband, Phil, and their daughter\\'s; Brianna and Brayton Doar with medical bills.     \\xa0     Cheryl loves tennis; she has a \"tennis family\", as she likes to call them, at Rally Point in RI. They have graciously set up a fundraiser there to assist Phil and the girls as well. If you have been kind enough to submit a monetary donation or plan to play tennis during their event for Cheryl; thank you.     This fund was created due to an overwhelming response to Cheryl\\'s illness from friends, friends of friends, neighbors and family who want to help; this platform can reach people both near and far. Phil and the girls appreciate the meals, cards and thoughtful messages. We all love Cheryl; when anyone speaks of her they all mention the same attributes; kind, loving, welcoming, warm and accepting. She is the first one willing to give to others and wanting to help. Lifting some of the burden of the medical bills will help Phil so much.     So whether you know Phil from his dumpster business, remember seeing Cheryl\\'s familiar face at my children\\'s sports events, know her from around town, through her own children or have known Cheryl and Ray since they were kids; anything you can do to help is appreciated.

       " '  Hello everyone, you may be keeping up to date with my father, Mark Pyorre’s, COVID battle through CaringBridge and quite a few of you have asked how you can help. We have set up a GoFundMe now after talking with Mark’s Palliative Care Team that this will be a long-term to potentially life-time battle. While my dad’s condition is still severe and we are waiting for him to make it into the ‘clear’, we do know his lungs are severely damaged and at this point he will have chronic lung disease for life. My dad has historically been the sole provider for his household, which includes my stepmom Shona (his wife of 16 years) and my younger brother, Mark Jr (age 13). We are hoping to ease their burden and my dad’s mind by raising funds for the unexpected medical costs and expected loss of income in their future.              My dad tested positive for COVID-19 on 9/1, was hospitalized 9/7 for an excruciating headache and low oxygen saturation, and was intubated and placed on a ventilator on 9/11/2021. On 9/26, we got the call at 1 AM to come to the hospital as his condition had deteriorated to being on 100% oxygen support while his blood oxygenation was only hovering at 81%. After spending several hours with him, praying and holding his hands, we were sent home as his condition had stabilized. We have only had this one opportunity to see him since he was admitted to the hospital, and have had to rely solely on daily updates from his doctors and nurses. He has been both heavily sedated and paralyzed on a ventilator for a full month now and has faced several setbacks in his recovery including a couple lung collapses and bacterial infections. He is currently the youngest person in the Mather VA hospital ICU with no pre-existing conditions.              On September 30th, Shona and I met with my father’s Palliative Care Team who were able to explain what the path forward may look like. Once he stabilizes from the tracheotomy, he will be placed in a Long-Term Acute Care facility (called an L-TAC) where he will need skilled, 24/7 care while he relearns basic functions and weans off the ventilator. They estimate he is currently looking at a minimum of 3-4 months at an L-TAC. His lungs are permanently damaged and it is likely he will need some type of oxygen support for life, but we won’t know what that will look like until he is further along in the recovery process. We are still seeking answers to what our future may look like and what kind of medical expenses the family will have but at this point we expect there to be costs associated with subsequent care and potential home/lifestyle modifications.              We know my dad is doing everything in his power to make it back to us and the last thing we want is for him to worry about finances when he comes to. My dad has taken great pride in providing for his family and helping friends whenever possible over the years, but he needs all of us now. My dad would already be blown away by the compassion and prayers you all have offered us through this tough time and I know it would warm his heart knowing his friends and community are reaching out to support his wife and son, whether that be emotionally, spiritually, or financially. The money raised from this GoFundMe will be towards medical-related expenses and housing costs.  ',\n",

After a month of battling with the virus, we lost Nora on New Years Eve.   Nora was an amazing woman, wife, mother and grandmother. She thought of everyone but herself. There is a gaping void within our family created by her death. As we continue to mourn the loss of such a selfless and giving soul, we are also supporting our father as he continues his battle against COVID. His body has been beaten up tremendously by this virus. By the grace of God, he has shown improvements.   When COVID-19 takes hold, it wreaks havoc upon the body. Our father has\\xa0lost nearly all muscle tone and starves to catch a deeper breath. As the virus subsides for him, it has left behind so much destruction and scarring, he will require extensive pulmonary rehabilitation which he has no access to via insurance or government programs.  \\xa0Nora and John were amazingly happy in life but not wealthy in the least. Our father had only basic VA insurance which does not provide any rehabilitative care, which he will need in abundance. He is too young for Medicare and because he made over $17K last year, he does not qualify for Medicaid either...  This gofundme account is to support the remembrance of Nora by building a fund to support our father's long rehabilitative road ahead. There are so many siblings, children, and grandchildren who relied on Nora and John's presence in their lives. \\xa0We will seek all rehabilitation options. \\xa0The cost of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation is upwards of $1800 per day.  We have lost Nora long before it was her time to go.\\xa0We cannot lose both of them.  In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to John Varga's battle and recovery against COVID.

As much as they give to the community, we hope the community can give back to them in their time of need.\\xa0   ',\n",
       " '  Hey y’all! My aunt Tracy is currently hospitalized with Covid and we do not know how long she will remain that way nor what needs she will have at discharge (oxygen, medications, etc). Unfortunately not only does she not have health insurance, she also has limited paid time off from work and will not have her income. She has a special needs son at home and needs every penny she earns. If you know Tracy personally, you know she is never one to ask for help, but is always the first to offer. Let’s bless her! Please give any amount you can. Maybe we can help give her some peace of mind. Money and bills is the last thing she needs to be worrying about. We need her focused on recovery so she can come home. Her boys, Kalli and Luke, and all of us miss her crazy self. Thank y’all in advance for your support. Please share!  ',\n",
       " 'My sister,  strong Liz Frank /strong , who\\xa0is a CVOR NURSE (cardiovascular operating room)\\xa0in Baton Rouge, LA contracted  strong COVID-19 /strong  at work while treating infected patients. Thankfully, she recovered from the infection but that\\xa0was just the beginning of the war she\\'s now  strong fighting /strong . \\xa0  strong Louisiana /strong  was\\xa0 strong hard hit /strong  by COVID and in order to accommodate the infected patients, the hospital she works at converted 15 units into COVID units. Surgery was reduced to emergency cases only so nurses who normally worked in the OR (like Liz), or other surgery driven areas, were asked to help the hospital in other areas. Because Liz had previous patient care experience on “the floor\" she  strong willingly volunteered /strong  to help on the COVID unit. \\xa0   strong Her first battle began  /strong two\\xa0weeks later when, on April 8th, she suddenly developed a fever, severe fatigue, GI upset and body aches. What followed was a  strong seven-week battle /strong . Her symptoms were terrible; she had a cough, fever, shortness of breath and body aches...Oooohhh, the body aches were the worst! She said the  strong pain was so bad /strong  that it felt like the first layer of her skin had been peeled off! During this time, she had multiple doctor visits, tests, x-rays, medications, lab work, and ER visits. Her breathing became so labored that she went back to the ER and was diagnosed with  strong multi lobe viral pneumonia /strong . She was hospitalized for a short time and then sent home on oxygen. After several weeks she started to improve. It looked like she was finally over the hump and we thought it would be uphill from here.   Liz was finally able to return to work on May 25th. She was expecting (hoping) to return full-time as soon as possible. Maybe pick up “call” and get some overtime. She worked four hours each day on the 25th, 26th &amp; 27th. She saw her doctor on the 27th, for a follow-up appointment, and he  strong pulled her out of work /strong . \\xa0  strong The second battle begins... /strong   \\xa0  strong New symptoms /strong  have begun. Liz is\\xa0experiencing after effects from COVID and doctors\\xa0have  strong no explanation /strong . The  strong excruciating pain has rendered her unable to work /strong .\\xa0Her joints are swollen, painful, unable to tolerate weight/pressure and she’s having stabbing “electrical” pains. Liz is in  strong constant pain /strong  when she stands or walks and, if she sits for any amount of time, her legs go numb and start to tingle from the knee down. She has developed pain in her cervical spine, muscle weakness, intermittent fevers, vision changes, memory/recall difficulties and persistent fatigue. \\xa0 Her life has been  strong severely impacted /strong . She says she has gone from “above capable to barely able to walk”. Running simple errands is almost impossible and she relies on a friend to help when possible. Every aspect of her daily life has been  strong altered in order for her to function /strong . She can’t wear tennis shoes most days because of the swelling in her feet. \\xa0She can’t lie down or sleep comfortably, and must elevate her legs so they don’t throb. Something as simple as washing and drying her hands is painful. Liz can hardly brush her hair and a victory for her is being able to wash her hair on her own.  \\xa0 Liz is a  strong hard-working single mom /strong  to two amazing kids (Duncan 18 &amp; Grace 12). Duncan has been suffering from seizures for several years and they are still trying to get them under control. \\xa0He is unable to work or drive (or have any independence) because of his seizures and essentially relies on Liz for everything. To make it worse, poor Liz is  strong devastate /strong d that her illness has made it difficult to be there for him.  \\xa0 As if the  strong unrelenting battle with COVID /strong  wasn’t enough, Liz is now in a  strong financial crisis /strong . She has been  strong out of work for\\xa03 months /strong  with  strong no hope /strong  of returning to work anytime soon. The small amount of money she managed to save has been  strong exhausted /strong \\xa0and she will not be able to make ends meet. On top of her everyday expenses, she has the expense of insurance premiums, copays, doctor/hospital bills. She currently owes several thousand in COVID related medical bills and the  strong costs will surely rise /strong  as she visits more doctors and undergoes more testing. \\xa0 Liz  strong URGENTLY\\xa0needs assistance /strong  supplementing her lost income. Friends, family and coworkers urged her to consider a GoFundMe campaign but when we discussed it she told me she just couldn’t bring herself to do it. So,  strong I’m asking you to help /strong  her. \\xa0 My husband is active duty Army and we currently live in VA with our 3 teenagers. I’m too far away to physically help her but I can try to\\xa0 strong ease her financial burden /strong . I love her and it’s  strong heartbreaking /strong  to see her in pain, afraid, angry, depressed and struggling. Right now, I just want her to rest and  strong concentrate on getting better /strong .  \\xa0 This  strong amazing nurse /strong , who has helped so many, now  strong needs our help /strong . She would greatly appreciate any support you can give. Not only monetary  strong donations /strong , but also  strong continued prayers /strong  for a complete recovery. \\xa0Please pray that she doesn\\'t suffer permanent damage or develop a chronic condition as a result of this  strong awful virus /strong . \\xa0  strong Thank you /strong  for taking the time to read about strong  Liz’s battle /strong  and  strong please share /strong  her story with others. \\xa0 With sincere gratitude, Jenny Buie Butler   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49188352_15933781765118_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49188352_15933781765118_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49188352_1593378209997860_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49188352_1593378209997860_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49188352_159337823289337_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49188352_159337823289337_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49188352_1593378290287615_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49188352_1593378290287615_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49188352_1593381639813357_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49188352_1593381639813357_r.jpeg\" / ',\n",

It embarrasses me greatly that I have to beg for help considering I am but one among many who needs assistance during this time of the global pandemic, but I am desperate.         I am the only child of a couple who had me late in their life. They are now both senior citizens. Papa had a stroke last 2019 and had been bedridden since. So it became my responsibility to support him for the past two years.         Last week, papa started coughing. It became so severe that it became almost impossible for him to breathe, so he had to be hospitalized. However, due to the surging numbers of COVID-19 patients here, hospitals are filled to capacity.         We had no choice but to admit him to a private hospital. We then found out that he was suffering from a sick combination of pneumonia, diabetes, high cholesterol, and the worst, COVID.         Due to this, we didn't expect that we would use up his health coverage in just two days. We would have gone ahead and had him discharged, but all quarantine facilities are full. He also can't come home because my mother and the others there are immunocompromised.         Hence, we are stuck at the private hospital.         I have a wife who is due to give birth to my firstborn by next month, so I can no longer shoulder all my father's hospital bills. It is heavy to carry this burden at this time when it should have been the most exciting time of my life knowing I will meet our baby girl soon, but such is life.

He was the sole provider of his household of 6. But months before falling ill to the virus, he became unemployed, barely getting through with some unemployment benefits. Since being hospitalized &amp; fighting for his life, economically, things have only been getting worse. They are 3 months behind in rent, behind in bills, without a car (which is currently in a car shop that requires at least $1000 to get it out), and other debts. Josefina is only asking for prayers for her beloved husband. She\\'s very humble and shy plus feels she can\\'t ask for more because of everyone\\'s situation thanks to the pandemic.

       " '  Hello,         My name is Pastor Henry Louis Adams. I want to share the story of my sister. Her name is Jacqueline Murray. She and her son was hospitalized with Double Covid Pneumonia in Cobb County. The doctors didn\\'t expect for her to pull through this. She spent weeks in the hospital fighting for her life. Before her Covid battle, she was an essential worker, a truck driver. She traveled the country delivering loads to keep stores stocked so that people like me, and you, could continue to survive during the pandemic.         Jacqueline recently changed jobs to another function, still an essential worker, she became a truck driver for a residential trash removal company that removes trash from residential neighborhoods in North Georgia. We are not sure how or where she contracted Covid. However, she informed that she became ill after others on her job recently had a bout with the virus. Before her hospitalization, Jacqueline was in the middle of searching for a new place to live for her and her son. The current residence in Cobb County in which she was renting had become inhabitable, and she could not afford to replace a collapsed ceiling again in a residence that did not belong to her. After saving her money, going to court and getting additional time to move out, she suddenly became ill with COVID-19 and was hospitalized. After she was hospitalized, her son also contracted the virus and was hospitalized also.         During her hospitalization, she kept in touch with me, her brother and Pastor about her situation. Not to alarm the family, we kept this a secret. I started researching places for her to live when I came across a listing on Zillow for a property located in Conyers, Ga. I was prompted to call the listing because it was affordable and was listed as a Private Owner. The picture of the property said to call the Private Owner. I called the Number on the listing and spoke Thomas Gonzales, who identified himself as the property owner. Mr. Gonzales said that the property in Conyers was not available, however he had some other properties that were. He emailed me the address of another property in Lithonia, Ga. I went to view the property in which he had me register for a site called Rently and scan my driver\\'s license and pay a 99cent fee to self-tour the home. I followed the directions with him on the phone as I retrieved the code and self toured the property. At this time, I called my sister, Jacqueline and connected with her via facetime to show her the property. She loved the property and wanted to fill out a application and secure the place with a deposit.         I filled out the application with Jacqueline\\'s permission and submitted the application via email to Thomas which identified himself as the Landlord. The next morning, I received an email back from Thomas that the application had been processed and congratulated us on being approved. He also requested a deposit to be sent to his wifes assistant via Paypal . He informed us that he had previously had the home on the market as a \"Rent to own\" property at 1795 a month but previously decided to remove it and rent it for 1400 a month with water and electric included.         Thomas emailed me a lease to sign and a request for 2800 which is first month rent and deposit. Jacqueline didnt have all the money needed to make the deposit. She explained to him that she had just gotten out of the hospital but could send 2000. Thomas agreed on the 2000 and we sent the funds via Paypal on October 7th, 2021.    Thomas agreed that we would pay the remaining 800 dollars on 10//9/2021 at the move in. Thomas and I agreed to meet at the property at 12 noon. Thomas never showed up at the property. After several calls and text, Thomas finally called back and informed that he had a flat tire, and he needed one hour more to get to the property. After one hour past, I called Thomas several times and he would not pick up his phone. I finally reached Thomas via phone around 3 PM that evening, approx 3 hours after our scheduled meet time for the key exchange. He informed me that he needed 2 more hours and that he would meet me at the property in a few more hours. I informed Thomas that if he didn\\'t want to do the deal that he could refund the 2000 dollar deposit that he received from us, and we would look elsewhere. He informed that he wanted to do the deal and that he would be there. He informed that he would call me before he arrived at the property.         Thomas never showed up at the property. Thomas scammed us and now Jacqueline is out of her savings of 2000. We sit here wondering what could possibly be in a person\\'s mind to scam a middle-aged essential worker that has been on the front line of this pandemic, serving the public. We shared with him her hospital fight with double Covid pneumonia and her being on oxygen, all the while being reeled into a scam to steal her money. I sit back and think, if she got the vaccine and was never hospitalized, would we have seen the red flags? Because of sickness and a near-death experience, maybe we were just blind. No one knows for sure. He was so poised and elaborate. But in the end, a diabolical scam artist.         Now Jacqueline needs a home to rent for her and her son. The 2000 dollars that she had saved to help with that has now been stolen from her due to no fault of her own. And Paypal will not refund the money.         It is my Prayer that she receives enough money to not only find a place to live but to pay her rent up for a year as she continues to recover. She is on oxygen, for now. For as a woman that has given so much to the world, maybe the world will return a helping hand. Thank you and God Bless.   img alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/60487839_1633913348224962_r.\"   /      ',\n",

En Radiología en una clínica de la ciudad de Mérida. Mi papá es trasplantado por lo que toma inmunosupresores, lo que quiere decir que tiene pocas defensas en su organismo, por lo tanto, cualquier enfermedad para mi papá puede llegar a ser muy peligrosa. En las últimas semanas luego de la segunda dosis de la Vacuna del COVID-19, su salud se ha visto considerablemente afectada, en un inicio los Médicos pensaron que eran efectos adversos y tardíos de la vacuna, luego de varios días de pruebas y exámenes, el día Viernes 03/05/21 se descubrió que parte de su fiebre y malestares venían dado por la Bacteria Salmonella Typhi, se inició con tratamiento, pero lamentablemente, no ha reaccionado favorablemente al mismo, y comenzó a tener problemas respiratorios y taquicardia por lo que por su delicada condición, se repitieron exámenes, dando positivo para COVID-19 y tuvo que ser internado de emergencia en el Centro Clínico de Mérida.  EL informe médico del neumólogo dice: Informe médico. Paciente: Orlando Nieto de sexo masculino de 59 años de edad quien representa insuficiencia respiratoria aguda, neumonía bilateral.

In the last few weeks after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, his health has been considerably affected. At first the doctors thought that they were adverse and late effects of the vaccine, after several days of tests and examinations, on Friday 03/05/21 it was discovered that part of his fever and discomfort were caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacteria; treatment was started, but unfortunately, he has not reacted favorably to it, and began to have respiratory problems and tachycardia (heart over 100 beats per minute), so due to his delicate condition, tests were repeated, giving positive for COVID-19 and he had to be hospitalized in emergency at the Centro Clínico de Merida.

Grandmother SaSa has been hospitalized for the past three months, beginning October 22, 2021, and will be discharged from a rehabilitation facility to her home in West Ossipee, New Hampshire, this Friday, January 21, 2022.  Having been in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks and nearly losing her fight on three separate occasions, Grandmother SaSa has worked diligently to regain her health after having three strains of COVID simultaneously. One of her doctors remarked, \"You are one strong woman.\" Grandmother SaSa, along with her family, is incredibly grateful for all the life-saving medical care she has received and knows she could not have survived without the dedicated medical expertise. However, she also knows there is a long way to go once she returns home.  Grandmother SaSa (White Swan of the North), a lifelong lover of the earth and its people whose heritage is Abenaki, Irish, Scottish, and Japanese has devoted much of her life to Prayer, Ceremony and serving humanity. In our conversation just today, Grandmother SaSa shared that she has much work yet to do and extends her sincerest gratitude to those who might consider helping ease this financial burden.',\n",
       " \"     My name is Jani. I’m a father of 4 young children and I’m currently battling COVID-19.                    When I contracted it in early December 2021, I was fully vaccinated – with no underlying conditions. But for some reason, I ended up with a more aggressive variant and I'm now hospitalized with reduced lung function.\\xa0            The prognosis is that I will survive, but the worse is still ahead and it may take months to fully recover. When I ultimately return home, I will initially be hooked to an oxygen tank until I can rebuild my lung function and breathe on my own.            There are, however, still many hurdles before I can even think about returning home.             b What do I need money for? /b             My hospital stay should be fully covered by medical insurance, as far as I know. But as a self-employed business owner, I don’t have a safety net when it comes to vacation or sick days. The past 18 months have been hard for my business, and I’ve braced through it mostly by burning my savings.            I'm a video game developer, and I have designed and programmed a game for Xbox that is completed and in the Microsoft certification process. This is what is supposed to make a living for our family in the near future. There is currently one known show-stopper that I need to fix before the game can be released. However, I can only fix that after I'm well enough to return home and do some work. Hence, the game profits is in the elusive future at this point.            I'm the sole breadwinner of our family of six, including my wife and four young kids. Mortgage, utility bills and other expenses rack up quickly while I'm recovering. When times get tough, I would normally supplement income with some consulting, but obviously that isn't an option now.               If you can help, it would mean a lot. I would need have my focus on surviving and recovering. I set the goal amount to what I think we would need in a month, but I suspect we will have additional expenses and the situation will linger for much longer. Since the initial goal was reached, I doubled the goal amount as I don’t think the ordeal is over too soon.  \",\n",

On Tuesday December 7th she tested positive for Covid. A week later she was hospitalized, intubated and put on a ventilator. She has been fighting this demon for almost 3 weeks now. She has been taking baby steps to improve and all her sats have at extubation levels but she is still not strong enough to fully breathe on her own. She is scheduled to get a Tracheotomy on Monday January 3 and she will slowly be able to wake up and start her rehabilitation.         Barb is one of the most selfless people you could ever meet. She will help anyone with anything whenever she can. She has been raising a special needs child for 26 years now and 5 years ago she added 2 more little girls to her clan who lost their mother to cancer. Being that she will be out of work for at least a few months things might become tight and we are trying to keep her stress free while she recovers. So now it’s our turn to help Barb out!

       " '   Hey Everyone! I am making this GoFundMe for my home care worker Phoenix. A couple Months ago my home care worker was diagnosed with Covid-19.  Phoenix has been diagnosed with clinical depression and unfortunately the Covid 19 exacerbated his condition. We all know that one must undergo isolation when contracted with Covid-19, but unfortunately this exacerbated his level of depression and he was hospitalized. Quarantine  combined with the hospitalization resulted in over three weeks of no income. Independent of that, Phoenix was involved in a car accident three weeks before contracting Covid, which left him without pay for ten days due to a lack of transportation to get to work. The combination of all these unforeseen circumstances  has left Phoenix financially unstable... barely able to make rent, utility bills, put gas in his car, and now medical bills to make things even worse.            I am doing this GoFundMe page because as a home care worker making $12.50\\xa0 an hour, it is already difficult to make ends meet. He is incredibly genuine, he has a heart of gold and he takes care of me as if we were family. Not many people want to do this work because of the inconceivable below minimum wages they receive, but not Phoenix. Without him, I would not be able to get in and out of bed, get in the shower, use the bathroom or eat.  He is truly my lifeline!           So if you have any money you can part with, please donate to Phoenix so he can get back on his feet and continue to do the amazing work he does for me everyday!   ',\n",

Fight...\" Eight weeks later she herself succumbed to a fatal case of COVID19.\\xa0 Why did I live and she died? My medical team said I shouldn\\'t blame myself because she had a \"cumulative viral load\" and no one patient caused her death.\\xa0 They can tell me that but how do I carry her death forward? They say the greatest gift we can give to those who have gone before us is to live more fully in their place. Since emerging from the hospital in April 2020, I have tried to do exactly that if for no other reason than to honor HER legacy.\\xa0 She was the hero.\\xa0 I was the person she cried while trying to save.\\xa0 Sitting in the devastation of this 2 year long Pandemic Nightmare, I still don\\'t have any good answers for it all.\\xa0   \\xa0     So, I emerged from the hospital to a closed down Country.\\xa0 Not even Walmart was open.\\xa0 I soon learned my aparment Lease came and went while I was hospitalized for I disappeared on a Sunday and no one - including my landlord - knew what happened to me.\\xa0 So I also lost all of my worldly belongings.\\xa0 I then lost my job due to COVID because I did elder care and - at that time - we did not know what we did not know about the virus and many thought because I had COVID and recovered that I could kill them if I came near them.\\xa0 Also, literally everyone I know is medically vulnerable in some way so staying with family/friends was not possible.\\xa0 So, there I was: unemployed, suffering from post-COVID symptoms (now known as Longhaul COVID), unhoused for the first time in my life and truly terrified.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     My journey from then until now included time spent in a \"homeless hotel\", a government-funded nursing home to rehab and recover from COVID, a 14 hour\\xa0 accidental visit to a mental health ward where I learned/observed the unimaginable happening to our beloved Gen Z kids there, and a crazy, fake \"rich woman\" scamming the government and anyone she could, as a certified sociopathic narcissist, to be able to continue to steal from others and live off OPM - because as a narcissist she feels ENTITLED to do so.\\xa0 NONE of this should have ever happened to me.\\xa0 But I learned a lot in this past 22 months and I would not trade any of it for much of anything; for these experiences fundamentally changed me because they challenged me on every level to rise above, to learn radical resilience and to survive in spite of a broken \"homeless system\" determined to let me die because that \"system\" never effectively rehouses anyone ever.\\xa0     \\xa0     If you read my Twitter feed you might see my references to \"jail\" and \"my jailgirz\".\\xa0 That is how I contracted COVID.\\xa0 Wrongfully arrested for the first time at the age of 50 for doing the RIGHT thing (think cross between protester and whistleblower), I was charged by our corrupt GOP government with a nonviolent first offense.\\xa0 I was given the chance to pay a bond and go home but I noticed something while detained in that jail: almost everyone detained with me was black or brown and the few \"pretty white girls\" who were there - they were sending ALL OF US home when it was well-known that POC have a higher mortality rate if exposed to COVID.\\xa0 So I refused to leave until they sent 5 POC detainees home before me.\\xa0 Those in charge at the jail HATED ME for this stand but that famous quote is true: if you are silent in the face of injustice - you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\\xa0 So, I got COVID in a janky jail, lost my housing, my job and my health as a result - hitting the COVID trifecta of \"adverse impact\" from COVID.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     I quickly realized the \"homeless outreach system in America\" is a scam, a shell game and a system that fundamentally fails most people it claims to serve.\\xa0 I have Huntington\\'s Disease so ideally require \"medically supportive living\" but I\\'m too young to be eligible for that type of housing.\\xa0 So many \"housing caseworkers\" told me that people like me - functional (no addictions/no serious mental illness) but medically vulnerable fall thru the cracks ALL THE TIME in America because there is just no help for someone like me.\"\\xa0 If I had a dollar for every time I was told that in the past 18 months - I could have already bought a modest home.\\xa0 I kid you not.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     My health declined rapidly post-COVID and together with a Huntington\\'s flare I went into horrifying medical decline with a 70 lb weight loss and losing most of my hair due to malnutritiona and my doctor thought it best for me to recover in a physical rehab facility.\\xa0 Sadly, it was a Medicaid government-funded nursing home whose greedy corporate owners line their pockets with government cash while essentially providing little more than a \"flophouse\" with no medical oversight.\\xa0 I entered this Facility in the Fall of 2020.\\xa0 What I recorded, documented and testified to that happened there when I became a witness against that Facility for the State would traumatize the most sturdy among us: rampant physical abuse, constant starvation, pregnancies caused by staff raping those in \"memory care\" and no PPE or COVID precautions taken by this Facility\\'s employees/management such that 109 people in a 110 bed Facility contracted COVID.\\xa0 Most died.\\xa0 The running narrative is that our elders in these congregant nursing homes were old and frail and EXPECTED to die from COVID.\\xa0 I am here to testify that nothing could be further from the truth.\\xa0 These Facilities were LOCKED DOWN and no investigations into CRITICAL LAPSES therein happened in the State of IL for 5 full months.\\xa0 It was a reckless disregard by the staff at these Facilities for our elders\\' safety and welfare that caused their deaths - not COVID.\\xa0 And guess what? You\\'re just expected to die if you\\'re in a nursing home so no autopsies are ever performed when a death occurs there and certainly none were during the first year of COVID.\\xa0 So many entirely preventable deaths....it haunts me to this day.\\xa0 But when I finally fled that Facility or my own medical safety in December 2020, I spent the next YEAR holding them accountable and advocating for better care for the Residents I left behind.\\xa0 It took nearly a year but I got all the bad actors fired including the Administrator and the Director of Nursing and now the Residents I remain friends with tell me things are measurably improved and they are now SAFE.\\xa0 That matters to me more than you might ever know.\\xa0 \\xa0     \\xa0     I therafter found temporary housing from March 2021 through July 2021 and I wrote a Memoir about my Pandemic experience.\\xa0 It is titled: \"Innoncent Bystander: How Reddit, Twitter and Radical Resilience Saved My Life During the Pandemic\" and is scheduled to publish March 2022.\\xa0 Some of our unhoused neighbors turn to drugs to alleviate the trauma that homelessness causes.\\xa0 I turned inward and found healing in my writing.\\xa0 I would like most folks to know that for the large marjority of our unhoused neighbors who struggle with substance abuse - the trauma of homelessness caused the addiction and not the reverse.\\xa0 I\\'m lucky, I guess, that I never chose that option.\\xa0 But with Huntington\\'s, alcohol and drugs only make my neurological problems much worse.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     I therafter moved to another \"rented room\" situation but this one turned bad quickly.\\xa0 I realized 9 days in to my new 6 month Lease that my landlady was a sociopathic narcissist.\\xa0 She ruled that house by force and by torture - emotional and physical.\\xa0 She has been stealing, scamming and living off OPM for decades and I was just her next mark.\\xa0 When she heard I had a book publishing and that I applied for and would receive THOUSANDS in Pandemic Rental Assitance, I just became her next \"mark\" or victim - unbeknownst to me.\\xa0 The day my Rental Assistance check came in the mail she had her live-in boyfriend physically attack me and threaten to murder me if I ever came back to the home - all so she could make off with the $7k in MY Rental Assistance from IHDA.\\xa0 Local police will not prosecute her because of her advanced age so she\\'s apparently just going to get away with absconding with money intended to provide me long-term housing in the aftermath of COVID.\\xa0 I am trying any way I can think of - including calling the FBI and State Police to try and hold her accountable.\\xa0 I have filed suit against her to try and recover the funds but the reality is - she has gotten away with stealing OPM, including her entire family\\'s money - her whole life.\\xa0 So she likely will get away with this theft too absent some intervening force.\\xa0 And all the while I remain unhoused and not helped by the very system supposed to help me: the homeless outreach system.\\xa0 I have been put on multiple years-long waiting lists for housing and am told it could be another 5 years before they ever get to my name on those lists.\\xa0 Sadly, I don\\'t have that kind of time with my diagnosis....     \\xa0     So what is next for me?\\xa0 I recently found a new \"rented room\" arrangement for the Winter months.\\xa0 I move there on the 29th of December.\\xa0 After that? Who knows.\\xa0 Because that\\'s the thing about sudden homelessness: statistically you are likely to suffer homelessness AGAIN once it has happened to you previously.\\xa0 It\\'s currently Christmas Night 2021 as I write this and I am sitting in my frozen 17 year old car, writing this on my free \"Obamaphone\" having only eaten food pantry peanut butter today on Christmas.\\xa0 But I am so thankful for the phone, the peanut butter and my failing car because I know THIS MUCH to be true: No matter how bad it is - it can ALWAYS be worse.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     A friend on Twitter suggested I create this GoFundMe in case anyone wants to help me restablize my life.\\xa0 What I most need immediately is:  1. To secure my 4 walls and pay for rent which is $1950.00 for the (3) months we agreed I would remain here.\\xa0     \\xa0     2. My 2005 car needs 2k in maintenance due to being neglected while I have not had a DIME to my name during this pandemic.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     3. First and last month\\'s rent + deposit for a proper YEAR LONG rental moving forward. I estimate this to be approximately $800 per month.\\xa0     \\xa0     4. I was rendered a victim of domestic violence as the result of having to flee following the assault at my former landlady\\'s home.\\xa0 So I AGAIN lost all of my belongings/possessions. Why? Because when I went back with Law Enforcement, the cops ALWAYS take the abuser\\'s side and what she had not outright STOLEN from me in my absence (between when I fled &amp; was allowed to return with L.E.) she told the cops were HER belongings and I was only able to secure but a few personal items SHE DEEMED to have no value/she couldn\\'t resell for a profit.\\xa0 As such, I am now in the prairie in Central IL with NONE of the following:     \\xa0     1. Winter coat/boots. 2. Proper Winter clothes. 3. Paper products &amp; household cleaners etc which EBT does not pay for 4. Personal hygiene items (soap, shampoo, lotion, chapstick etc) 5. Things needed for my NEW rented room: bedding, towels, curtains, crockpot, area rugs, etc.\\xa0     \\xa0     They say it takes a village to help 1 unhoused person make the leap from the violence of the street to safely housed again.\\xa0 I am asking social media and my TwitterFam to be MY Village.\\xa0 I promise you I will \"pay it forward\" when I get to where I\\'m going after my Pandemic Memoir publishes.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     I thank anyone who decides to help me and will send anyone who does a free copy of my book when it publishes in March 2022.\\xa0 But you also have the knowledge that I am one of the your \"unhoused neighbors\" who is fighting the good fight, holding failing Agencies and government programs accountable while always going to bat for those more vulnerable than I am.\\xa0 I will never change. It is who my beloved veteran (deceased 2019) father raised me to be.\\xa0 As a result,\\xa0 I firmly believe that when I escape the fire and trials of life, I have a moral obligation to carry water back to those still consumed by the flames.\\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0     Thank you for reading my GoFundMe.\\xa0\\xa0     ',\n",

       " \"  Hi, my name is Karina. I started this fundraiser for my sister, Yesenia, her husband, Jason, and my 3 beautiful nieces.     \\xa0     Shortly before Christmas, Jason tested positive for Covid-19. Soon after, my sister tested positive as well. Along with battling this virus, feeling horrible and having to take care of one another, they have been unable to attend work. Any and all income for the home has stopped. However, their financial responsibilities have not stopped. They have fallen behind on utilities and rent, and do not have much resources for food. Unfortunately, Jason has had complications and is currently hospitalized. Yesenia is still sick at home, and unable to work. Christmas has come and gone and this family had to spend it horribly sick, and split apart. They have a long way to go until their back at work, and income starts to come in.     \\xa0     Anyone who knows Yesenia and/or Jason, know that these individuals have always openly and lovingly given to others. They are one of the most generous people I know. It breaks our hearts to watch them go through this. I hope that we can help them as much as they have helped others over the years.     \\xa0     Please help them get back on their feet. We're asking for funds to help with rent, utilities, food, and essentials. Any and all assistance is greatly appreciated and would be a great blessing for them at this time of need. It would mean the world to our family, if you could help us reach our goal.     \\xa0     ----     \\xa0     Hola, mi nombre es Karina. Comencé esta recaudación de fondos para mi hermana Yesenia, su esposo, Jason y mis 3 hermosas sobrinas.     \\xa0     Poco antes de Navidad, Jason dio positivo por Covid-19. Poco después, mi hermana también dio positivo. Además de luchar contra este virus, sentirse horrible y tener que cuidarse unos a otros, no han podido asistir al trabajo. Todos y cada uno de los ingresos de la casa se han detenido. Sin embargo, sus responsabilidades financieras no se han detenido. Se han atrasado en los servicios públicos y el alquiler, y no tienen muchos recursos para comprar alimentos. Desafortunadamente, Jason ha tenido complicaciones y actualmente está hospitalizado. Yesenia todavía está enferma en casa y no puede trabajar. La Navidad llegó y se fue y esta familia tuvo que pasarla horriblemente enferma y separarse. Tienen un largo camino por recorrer hasta que vuelvan al trabajo y los ingresos comiencen a llegar.     \\xa0     Cualquiera que conozca a Yesenia y / o Jason, sepa que estas personas siempre se han entregado abierta y amorosamente a los demás. Son una de las personas más generosas que conozco. Nos rompe el corazón verlos pasar por esto. Espero que podamos ayudarlos tanto como ellos han ayudado a otros a lo largo de los años.     \\xa0     Por favor ayúdelos a recuperarse. Estamos solicitando fondos para ayudar con el alquiler, los servicios públicos, la comida y los artículos básicos. Cualquier ayuda es muy apreciada y sería una gran bendición para ellos en este momento de necesidad. Significaría mucho para nuestra familia, si pudieras ayudarnos a alcanzar nuestra meta.  \",\n",

       " '  My name is Jean Tripam, and I am organizing this campaign for my brother Joe and his family. Joe was hospitalized with Covid 19. This fundraiser is to help his family with medical and financial challenges that they are dealing with as Joe begins his long road to recovery. Joe was denied Social Security Disability and will now need to hire an attorney to fight for his benefits. Joe is a husband and father of two daughters and a son. He always there to help his friends, family and neighbors and always with a huge smile on his face.         On April 8th, 2021, Joe went to the hospital with Covid. Over the next six days, he received a course of antiviral medication, IV fluids and oxygen. He was sent home on the 14th with an oxygen tank and some steroids. The following morning, Joe was rushed back to the hospital and into the ICU with viral pneumonia. He was given a second round of antiviral medication, but his lungs were very weak and he was put in a medically induced coma once he was put on the ventilator.         Over the next 7 weeks, a Tracheotomy was needed as the doctors and nurses worked to ween Joe off the ventilator. He fought hard to overcome numerous spontaneous pneumothorax which required a tube to be inserted into his chest cavity. His heart rate and blood pressure kept spiking and the pain and the anxiety were so bad, there was concern he would have a heart attack. Joe kept fighting and was finally taken off the ventilator.         On September 5th, Joe was moved to a subacute rehab facility to begin his occupational and physical therapy.  The doctors have decided to leave his trach in. This is there in case he needs oxygen support while working to regain his strength. He currently is able to sit up at the end of his bed for about 5-7 minutes before he becomes fatigued. He is able to eat soft foods and drink fluids on his own.         I would like to thank everyone for all the thoughts and prayers for Joe and our family. I will be adding updates each week on Joe’s progress. Thank you!  ',\n",
       " \"   Hi, my name is Beth Schreiber and I am raising money for the Severson family. I am blessed to work with Maria at Stevensville Schools and call her my dear friend. Her husband Tony contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized on September 17th. There were no available beds or ambulances in Missoula, so an ambulance from Deer Lodge arrived and transported him to Butte. He has been battling ever since, away from his loved ones, amidst a few set backs, several medical interventions, and no clear release date. Tony is a wonderful family man; father to two grown boys, a daughter in law, and a new grandfather of a beautiful baby girl. Many know him as the Kwik Dry Carpet Cleaning guy, and he's the first one many call when they need a hand, an ear, or a good laugh. As a small business owner Tony has not been able to work through this illness or collect an income, the end is not yet in sight, and the day to day expenses are too much for Maria to handle on just her own public school salary. They will further need to meet their high deductible before insurance will kick in to cover any expenses. Many in the world have been deeply affected by this pandemic and feel helpless to do anything about it. If you fit in that category as I do, here's a brilliant opportunity to help. Any little bit could go a long way, and please forward along to as many others as you are willing. Blessings to you all and may you and yours stay safe and healthy in this difficult time.   \",\n",

       " '  Hi my name is Lisa and I am generating this gofundme to help my brother Steven Polczynski and his family to cover their medical expenses and long term rehab services as a result of the lingering complications from COVID-19.  He contracted the virus by conducting a selfless act by taking care of our mother when she contracted the COVID-19 virus and unfortunately succumbed to the illness. His COVID journey has been critical, life threatening and lengthy. As of today 9/14/21 it has been 469 days of being hospitalized in either an ICU or a long term care rehab facility. He has exhausted all of his benefits with his insurance company and now his family is forced to cover all his medical expenses for rehab. He needs extensive physical therapy and is unable to obtain these services as needed due to the exorbitant costs of his care. He was on the ventilator for 7 long months and two cardiac arrests. On day 333, we were hopeful that he was coming home from rehab and staying home. But, that was short-lived. He went back to the hospital due to infections. Then back to the rehab facility for a couple more months. He is a fighter and one of the strongest people I know. He is home due to the families inability to cover the expenses of the long term facility where he was getting extensive physical therapy. He needs daily skilled nursing care and physical therapy. Please help us raise the funds for Steven and his family for medical expenses and to help make their home handicap accessible. I want to Thank you from the bottom of my heart for contributing to Steven\\'s cause and helping him beat all odds. HE IS A FIGHTER AND HAS NEVER GIVEN UP.

       " \"   strong Help our parents, Jennifer Zapata &amp; Bladimir Molano, recover from COVID-19  /strong      \\xa0      em This campaign was organized by Elliott Powell (colleague of Jennifer Zapata at Sustainable Harvest International) for Maria Fernanda Torres Zapata. For the English version, please scroll down. /em      \\xa0      em Esta campaña fue organizada por Elliott Powell (colega de Jennifer Zapata en Sustainable Harvest International) por Maria Fernanda Torres Zapata. Para la versión en inglés, desplácese hacia abajo. /em      \\xa0     \\xa0     Mi nombre es Maria Fernanda, en nombre de mis hermanos Joan Camila, Juan Manuel, Bladimir Andre y toda la familia , hoy solicitamos su ayuda porque nuestros padres, Jennifer y Bladimir, están en la UCI de un hospital aquí en Nicaragua luchando por sus vidas con COVID-19.     \\xa0     El 18 de septiembre de 2021 falleció nuestra abuela materna María Esperanza luego de estar 2 semanas en agonía debido a la enfermedad del Delta del COVID 19. Su muerte se produjo en un momento en que experimentamos el pico más alto del Delta del Covid 19 en Nicaragua, y era casi imposible para nosotros obtener oxígeno, y el oxígeno que obtuvimos fue revendido por hasta $ 2,500 por un tanque vacío. En última instancia, fue la falta de oxígeno lo que provocó que sus órganos fallaran. No puedo explicarte el dolor que todos sentimos, aunque sabemos que hicimos todo lo posible, todavía sentimos que no fue suficiente.     \\xa0     Los días siguientes se sintieron muy extraños y vacíos sin nuestra abuela, sin embargo teníamos que seguir adelante con nuestra vida y nuestra salud. A mi madre Jennifer le preocupaba mucho que el virus COVID 19 Delta continuara en nuestra casa, por eso decidió pedir a todos los familiares que viven en casa que se hicieran una prueba de PCR. Como mi madre y yo éramos los que pasábamos más tiempo con nuestra abuela, nuestra prueba de PCR resultó positiva. Nuestro médico inmediatamente nos hizo iniciar el tratamiento Delta anti COVID 19.     \\xa0     El lunes 27 de septiembre, los niveles de oxígeno de mi madre comenzaron a bajar. Ya no podía moverse sola, no podía hablar porque si hacía el menor intento de hablar, el oxígeno bajaba aún más. Gracias a Dios pudimos llenar y pedir prestados tanques de oxígeno para mi madre. Mi madre se sometió a exámenes de rayos X para ver el pulmón y si había algún hongo. Para nuestra sorpresa, la baja saturación de oxígeno se debió a que el hongo ya se estaba desarrollando rápidamente en las paredes pulmonares, lo que nos alarmó mucho ya que nuestra abuela falleció por el mismo motivo y temíamos que pasara lo mismo con mi madre.     \\xa0     El 29 de septiembre, el nivel de oxígeno en sangre de mi madre volvió a bajar y ya no teníamos suficiente oxígeno para suministrar. La llevamos a un hospital público, rezando para que no muriera en el camino, y fue ingresada en la UCI en un hospital público. Ya no podíamos pagar un hospital privado porque teníamos muchas deudas por medicamentos, un médico privado y oxígeno: casi $10,000. Al 30 de septiembre, mi madre estaba conectada a un ventilador mecánico y el 80% de sus pulmones estaban afectados por el hongo.     \\xa0     El 1 de octubre, tuvimos que llevar a mi papá, Bladimir, a la sala de emergencias porque su nivel de oxígeno en sangre bajó drásticamente. Sospechamos que contrajo el virus mientras cuidaba a mi madre.     \\xa0     Dado que el hospital donde están mis padres en la UCI es público, no tienen todos los medicamentos ni las necesidades de ambos pacientes. Todos los días les traemos medicinas que el hospital no tiene: suero para adultos, comida / sopa, biberones con agua, gelatina, pampers para adultos, entre otros artículos de higiene personal para nuestros padres. No hemos podido ver a nuestros padres desde que están en la UCI. La noticia no es muy alentadora ya que los médicos nos dicen que se trata de una recuperación lenta de semanas o incluso meses.     \\xa0     Tengo 20 años, soy la mayor de mis hermanos y estoy a cargo de ellos mientras mis padres están en el hospital y me encargo de llevar a mis padres hospitalizados lo que necesitan. Me encargo de ser el apoyo de la familia en estos tiempos difíciles. Es por eso que hoy, en nombre de nuestra familia, decidimos contar nuestra historia para pedir humildemente cualquier tipo de apoyo que se pueda brindar. Ya sea compartiendo o donando, cualquier palabra e intención traerá un enorme alivio a esta familia que busca recuperarse de una situación inconcebiblemente dolorosa.     \\xa0     Todo ese aporte económico se destinará a los gastos de medicinas, artículos de higiene personal, así como alimentos para nuestra familia mientras nuestros padres estén hospitalizados. Todos los fondos donados a través de GoFundMe serán transferidos a mí, María Fernanda Torres Zapata, a través de Elliott Powell.     \\xa0     No hay palabras de agradecimiento y nuestra más sincera gratitud a todos los que nos han apoyado, compartido y estado con nosotros durante estos momentos aflictivos. Siempre vivirán en nuestros corazones.     \\xa0      strong ENGLISH VERSION: /strong      \\xa0     My name is Maria Fernanda. On behalf of my brothers Joan Camila, Juan Manuel, Bladimir Andre and the whole family, we ask for your help today because our parents, Jennifer and Bladimir, are in the ICU in Nicaragua fighting for their lives with COVID-19.     \\xa0     On September 18, 2021, our maternal grandmother María Esperanza, passed away after being 2 weeks in agony due to the COVID 19 Delta disease. Her death came at a time when we experienced the highest peak of the Covid 19 Delta in Nicaragua, and it was almost impossible for us to get oxygen, and the oxygen we did get was resold for up to $2,500 for an empty tank. It was ultimately a lack of oxygen that caused her organs to fail. I cannot explain to you the pain we all feel, although we know that we did everything possible, we still feel that it was not enough.     \\xa0     The following days felt very strange and empty without our grandmother, however we had to get on with our lives and our health. My mother Jennifer was very concerned that the COVID 19 Delta virus would continue in our house, that is why she decided to ask all the relatives who live at home to take a PCR test. Since my mother and I were the ones who spent the most time with our grandmother, our PCR test came out positive. Our doctor immediately made us start the anti COVID 19 Delta treatment.     \\xa0     On Monday, September 27, my mother’s oxygen levels began to drop. She couldn't move on her own anymore, she couldn't speak because if she made the slightest attempt to speak, the oxygen dropped even more. Thank God we were able to fill and borrow oxygen tanks for my mother. My mother underwent x-ray examinations to see the lung and if there was any fungus. To our surprise, the low oxygen saturation was due to the fact that the fungus was already developing rapidly in the lung walls, which alarmed us a lot since our grandmother passed away for the same reason and we were afraid that the same would happen with my mother.     \\xa0     On September 29, my mother’s blood oxygen level dropped again and we no longer had enough oxygen to supply. We drove her to a public hospital, praying she did not die along the way, and she was admitted to the ICU in a public hospital. We were no longer able to pay a private hospital since we had many debts for medication, a private doctor, and oxygen—almost $10,000. As of September 30, my mother was on a mechanical ventilator and 80% of her lungs were affected due to the fungus.     \\xa0     On October 1, we had to take my dad, Bladimir, to the emergency room because his blood oxygen level dropped drastically. We suspected he caught the virus while taking care of my mother.     \\xa0     Since the hospital where my parents are in the ICU is public, they do not have all the medications or needs of both patients. Every day we bring them medicines that the hospital does not have, serum for adults, food / soup, bottles with water, jelly, pampers for adults, among other personal hygiene items for our parents. We have not been able to see our parents since they are in the ICU. The news is not very encouraging as doctors tell us that this is a slow recovery of weeks or even months.     \\xa0     I am 20 years old, I am the oldest of my siblings and I am in charge of them while my parents are in the hospital and in charge of getting my hospitalized parents what they need. I am in charge of being the support of the family in these difficult times. This is why today, on behalf of our family, we decided to tell our story in order to ask humbly for any kind of support that can be given. Whether sharing or donating, any words and intentions will bring enormous relief to this family seeking to recover from an inconceivably painful situation.     \\xa0     All that economic contribution will be used for the expenses of medicines, personal hygiene items, as well as food for our family while our parents are hospitalized. All funds donated through GoFundMe will be transferred to me, María Fernanda Torres Zapata, by way of Elliott Powell.     \\xa0     There are no words of thanks and our sincere gratitude to all who have supported, shared, and been with us through these distressing times. You will always live in our hearts.  \",\n",
       " '  Hi, my name is Michelle, I am Max Fernandes’ niece, and I am asking for help for him and my    Aunt Chris as he recovers from COVID.         As many of you know, besides being a member of The Fat Chance Band, my uncle is a self-employed contractor running the US Mail from PA to Forks and LaPush. Last Tuesday he became extremely ill while working, and had to be hospitalized in Forks. Even though he was fully vaccinated, he tested positive for COVID.         They started treatment, and anticipated he would be home by Sunday. That did not happen as his condition worsened despite treatment, and the decision was made to transfer him to OMC in the early hours of Sunday morning.         The current update from the Dr is that his prognosis is good. He will recover, however it will not be a quick recovery, and it will be some time before he can fully return to work.         Not only does he face the additional expenses for having to have someone cover his route while he recovers for an extended period of time, but his truck will now require some major repairs that were unexpected.         Thank you for your help and support during this difficult time for our family.  ',\n",
       " '     Hello. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. In May of this year, my family all came down with Covid-19. Recovering from this has been the hardest thing we have ever faced. Myself and my Granddaughter recovered but my husband Ricky had to be hospitalized with respiratory failure related to Covid-19. He was in the hospital for five days. He hasn’t been able to work since first of May. He’s still on oxygen and recently found out he has heart problems and needs to have his heart shocked back into rhythm. His cardiologist has concerns about him having a stroke because of his heart being out of rhythm.  Then on July 8th, my 82 year old Mother had to have brain surgery for a non-cancerous meningioma. The doctors have been watching it for years for any change. It started to grow this past year enough to cause her problems with it pushing against her brain.  Because of her age, her recovery has not been going well, and I’ve had to take time off from my work. At first I was getting paid with  advanced sick leave, but reached the max very quickly and wasn’t getting paid.  I was able to pay most of the bills, but after not getting paid when I was caring for Mother, it’s not possible anymore. It’s getting harder everyday just to keep groceries in the house and the lights on. I worry everyday that the landlord will get tired of the rent being late every month and decide to not renew our lease in a couple of months. The money donated will be used to pay rent, utilities, groceries, gas, medication, and the oxygen that Ricky still needs.  Prayers would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you and God Bless          strong    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59567303_1630263628901040_r.jpeg\" alt=\"59567303_1630263628901040_r.jpeg\"     /   Even if you don\\'t donate, I ask that you do pray for Ricky and Mother. Pray for me to continue to have the strength to take care of them. Thank you and God Bless. /strong     ',\n",
       " '  Hi, I’m Jenni Eisenhauer and I’m fundraising for my family.     I’m December of 2020 I got Covid. It turned into Covid-pneumonia and I was hospitalized on New Years Eve. The doctor told me it was the worst case they’d seen up to that point, my lungs looked like they were made of glass. I was able to go home about a week later, but I was on oxygen. I also had complications with my heart and I developed a hernia from the constant intense coughing and my asthma went from easy controlled to needing daily steroids. I’ve had two surgeries since then and almost a year \\xa0later, \\xa0I am still on oxygen. The cost of the equipment isn’t fully covered by our insurance and we had to start choosing which bills are most important. The costs have snowballed, not only are we behind on bills, we’re struggling to make payments on the oxygen equipment that I still need daily. I am not able to work like I did before and my husbands job is just keeping us afloat. We’ve tried applying for government assistance, but we were denied. The only way for them to help is to be dishonest about my relationship with my husband, this isn’t an option for us. Lying and deceiving people isn’t how we do life. Our families &amp; church have helped us and our faith family has been incredibly supportive during this time. We were also blessed to be able to participate in a local organization called Hope of Lancaster. Honestly, it’s been a relief to not worry as much. There other bills we’re still trying to take care of, if you can pray, donate or just share our link, we know that this will bring a blessing to our family.\\xa0     Thank you so much!  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/60404243_1637695798541818_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"60404243_1637695798541818_r.jpeg\" /   ',\n",

Su estado de salud regresó a cero, retrocedió todo lo que había avanzado.\\xa0   Después de practicarle exámenes el doctor nos dijo que su síndrome ya lo estaba afectando, tenia vasculitis, adicional tenía neumonía y de 25 partes de los pulmones seguía teniendo 24 severamente dañadas.\\xa0   Lo empezó a tratar además del infectólogo, un neumólogo y reumatólogo, debido a la gravedad\\xa0 de su diagnóstico   Hoy jueves 17 de junio, está controlada su vasculitis, aún tienen neumonía, los pulmones inflamados y además dañados, está con una dosis de 250mg de corticoides para bajar inflamación y luego empiezan con una medicina que se llama Kitoscell (para cicatrizar)\\xa0   Ha estado ya dos veces a punto de ser intubado pero Pavel es una persona fuerte y positiva, les agradece a todos su apoyo. ****UPDATE/ACTUALIZACION: WE ARE HALFWAY TO OUR GOAL! We wanted to take a moment to update on Pavel\\'s progress, and thank each and every person who has been with us through this cause. Last Sunday, Pavel was brought back home, and he had a very strenuous transition due to the pressurization of his oxygen. Monday morning, he was transported back into the ICU, and was put back on a non-invasive ventilator. His doctors consulted with a rheumatologist (for his Churg-Strauss) and a pulmonologist to get a better understanding of what was causing his deterioration. It was found that his syndrome was flaring up do to a potential Pneumonia infection. He was put on a new round of steroids, scarring medication for his lungs, and antibiotics; and he has progressively improved over the last couple of days.\\xa0 His oxygen levels have normalized again, his inflammation is under control, but he is going to have to remain in the hospital, most likely, for another week. We are so elated that his treatments are working, and that everyday he has been strong enough to keep on fighting for all of us. Thank you again, from the bottom of our hearts, to every single one of you. Donations in Nicaragua have been over $2,000 so we are right at the midway point of our goal! Unfortunately, this fight is not over and the costs for Pavel and Daysi keep rising. If you can, please keep sharing in support of this young loving family.\\xa0  ****Si estas en Nicaragua y te gustaría donar directamente, donaciones en dólares pueden ser hechas a nombre de Pavel Arana cuenta numero 363310483 de BAC.\\xa0  *** ESTAMOS A MEDIO CAMINO DE NUESTRA META! Queríamos tomar un momento para ponerlos al día con el progreso de Pavel, y agradecer a cada una de las personas que han estado con nosotros atreves de esta causa. El pasado Domingo, Pavel fue transportado a casa, pero tuvo una primera noche muy ardua por falta de presión en su tanque de oxigeno. Lunes por la mañana tuvo que ser internado nuevamente en cuidados intensivos, y puesto con un ventilador no invasivo. Sus doctores consultaron a un reumatólogo (por su Churg-Strauss) y a un pulmonólogo para entender mejor que estaba causando su deterioro. Encontraron que sus pulmones estaban inflamados por un nuevo brote de su síndrome, empeorado por una infección de neumonía. Le administraron una nueva ronda de esteroides, cicatrizantes, y antibióticos; y ha podido mejorar progresivamente los últimos días. Sus niveles de oxigeno se han ido normalizando, su inflamación esta bajo control, pero va tener que mantenerse hospitalizado por otra semana. Estamos aliviados que sus tratamientos estén dando resultados, y que cada día Pavel se ha mantenido fuerte para seguir luchando por nosotros. Gracias, desde el fondo de nuestros corazones, a cada uno de ustedes. Las donaciones en Nicaragua ya han superado los $2,000 dejándonos justo al medio de nuestra meta! Desafortunadamente, la lucha no acaba y los costos siguen subiendo para Pavel y Daysi. Si pueden, por favor sigan compartiendo en apoyo para esta joven familia llena de amor.  In English: \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Over three years ago, after many months of doctor visits, our family received a heart breaking diagnosis. Our 35 year old brother, Pavel Arana, had been suffering from an incurable immune disease known as Churg Strauss Syndrome. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a disorder marked by blood vessel inflammation. This inflammation can restrict blood flow to organs and tissues, especially the lungs, sometimes permanently damaging them. Pavel is one of only 5 cases in Nicaragua, but he kept strong and healthy, and has been able to maintain the disease in check with permanent medication, and unfortunately, a compromised immune system. When the coronavirus pandemic hit Nicaragua, we feared the inevitable, but kept up with safety precautions the best our lives allowed. Sadly, even with his healthy lifestyle and safety practices, Pavel started developing symptoms May 27th of this year and was hospitalized in the ICU on May 31st. Pavel is a devoted father to his son Martin, an adoring husband to Daysi, a doting son to Mario and Mignone, a loyal friend (to more than we could name), and an unconditional brother to Marcel, Mario, and Gabriela. He has been our grounded rock in some of the hardest times for our family, and now we are looking for support to give him back his life. \\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 After Pavel’s hospitalization on May 31st, he remained for 7 days in the Covid-19 Intensive Care Unit of Vivian Pellas Hospital. He’s staying an additional 8 days for observation; and on Sunday, he will be moved home by ambulance, due to his oxygen dependency. He will need two additional weeks of 24 hour care from home, with physical therapy for his breathing. Unfortunately, in Nicaragua, insurance agencies are not covering any sort of Covid care, and all hospitals have to charge a premium for coronavirus related treatments. Pavel entered the ICU with his C-reactive proteins at 400 (100 is considered life threatening ), and in his x-rays they saw that 95% of his lungs were showing inflammation brought on by his preexisting condition and the Covid-19 infection. He was put on immunosuppressant steroids, and he needed a plasma transfusion to help his body fight off the infection. Regrettably his blood type was not available. They worked on building up his breathing exercises but, after three days of little improvement, the decision was made to put him on a non-invasive oxygen ventilator to supplement his breathing, with the possibility of having to be intubated and put on an invasive ventilator. Pavel is not the kind of person to give up, even with everything against him after 2 days on the mask Pavel’s numbers started improving, he started normalizing his breathing, talking more, and even standing and walking on his own. Pavel is slowly on the road to full recovery but moving him home is going to be a new set of challenges. Due to his compromised immune system, he will need to quarantine further. He will be dependent on oxygen, corticosteroids for inflammation, Kitoscell for scarring, round the clock care, and daily physical therapy. He has not been able to work since his hospitalization and, will not be strong enough to return to work for several weeks. Additionally, medical bills are close to $35,000 plus $1,200 for his full time care, $750 for physical therapy, and over $2,000 just for oxygen and medications. We are all going through extremely difficult unprecedented times, but we humbly ask for your support in any form that you can spare. Whether it is a share or a donation anything at this point would be much needed relief for a young loving family looking to recover from such a painful situation.  For people donating from The United States, all funds collected will be transferred directly to Pavel and Daysi in Nicaragua. If you are in Nicaragua and would like to donate to them directly, dollar donations can be made to  Pavel Arana\\'s BAC account 363310483.  Our sincerest gratitude to everyone who has contributed, shared, and been with us through these arduous moments. You will forever and always live in our hearts.   En Español:  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Hace ya tres años, después de meses de visitas al doctor, nuestra familia recibió un diagnóstico devastador. \\xa0Nuestro hermano de 35 años, Pavel Arana, padecía de una enfermedad inmunológica incurable conocida como el Síndrome de Churg-Strauss. Este síndrome es una condición marcada por la inflamación de las vesículas. Estas inflamaciones pueden restringir la presión sanguínea a los órganos y tejidos, especialmente los pulmones, en algunos casos hasta permanentemente dañándolos. Pavel es uno de sólo cinco casos en toda Nicaragua, pero con esfuerzo y una dieta rigurosa, el ha logrado mantener su enfermedad bajo control con medicamento permanente, y desafortunadamente, con un sistema inmunológico comprometido.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Cuando la pandemia del coronavirus llegó a Nicaragua, temimos lo inevitable, pero siempre mantuvimos nuestras precauciones de salud a cómo nuestras vidas permitieron. Tristemente, aun con su buena salud y cuidado, Pavel comenzó a mostrar síntomas el pasado 27 de Mayo, y fue hospitalizado en cuidados intensivos el pasado 31 de Mayo. Pavel es un papá dedicado a su hijo Martin, es un esposo lleno de adoración por Daysi, un hijo devoto a sus \\xa0padres Mario y Mignone, es un amigo leal (a más individuos que podemos nombrar), y un hermano incondicional a Marcel, Mario, y Gabriela. Él ha sido un pilar en los momentos más difíciles de nuestra familia, y ahora estamos buscando apoyo para devolverle un poco de normalidad a su vida.  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Después de su hospitalización el 31 de Mayo, Pavel residió por siete días en el ala de cuidados intensivos para pacientes con Covid-19 del Hospital Vivian Pellas. Lo mantendrán en observación por ocho días adicionales, y este domingo, será trasladado de vuelta a casa en ambulancia, por su dependencia al oxígeno. Adicionalmente, desde casa necesitará mantener atención especializada 24 horas al día, por dos semanas, con terapia física para fortalecer sus pulmones. En Nicaragua, las compañías de seguro no cubren ningún tipo de cuidado para el coronavirus, y todos los hospitales han tenido que subir sus costos para este tipo de tratamientos.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Pavel entró a cuidados intensivos con su proteína C reactiva en los 400 (100 es considerado altamente peligroso), y en su radiografía se vio que 95% de sus pulmones mostraban inflamación causada por el virus y su condición inmunológica. Le dieron esteroides inmunosupresores, y requería una transfusión de plasma para suplementar sus defensas. Sin embargo, su tipo de sangre no se encontraba disponible. Trabajaron en fortalecer su respiración pero, después de tres días con pocos resultados, tomaron la decisión de ponerle un ventilador  no-invasivo de oxígeno. Si no mejoraba con este, tendría qua ser intubado. Pavel no es el tipo de persona que se da por vencido, aun con todo en su contra, después de dos días con el ventilador no-invasivo, su Proteína C reactiva se redujo, su respiración mejoró, recobró el habla, y hasta pudo dar unos cuantos pasos. Gracias a Dios, Pavel está en camino a una recuperación completa pero lenta y tenerlo en casa vendrá con sus nuevos desafíos.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Dado que su sistema inmunológico está comprometido, tendrá que mantenerse en cuarentena durante las próximas dos semanas. Va tener completa dependencia de su oxígeno, corticoides para la inflamación, Kitoscell para cicatrizar, atención especializada las 24 horas del día, y terapia física semanal para sus pulmones. No ha sido capaz de trabajar desde su hospitalización, y no estará lo suficientemente fuerte para regresar por varias semanas. Adicionalmente, las cuentas médicas llegaron casi a los $35,000: más $1,200 para su cuidado en casa, $750 para su terapia física, y otros casi $2,000 solo en oxígeno y medicamentos. Todos estamos viviendo por tiempos extremadamente difíciles, pero les pedimos humildemente por cualquier tipo de apoyo que puedan dar. Ya sea compartiendo o donando, cualquier palabras e intenciones traerán un enorme alivio a una joven familia buscando cómo recuperarse de una situación inconcebiblemente dolorosa.\\xa0  \\xa0Personas donando desde Estados Unidos, todos los fondos recolectados serán transferidos directamente a Pavel y Daysi en Nicaragua.

       " '   strong English:\\xa0 /strong This is my father-in-law Inocencio Valverde and covid-19 should’ve been his cause of death. However he is a resilient man who fought a good fight and won. Doctors and nurses really didn’t think he was gonna make it. We were told his chances of survival were a single digit number. Death was holding his hand and all we could do was pray. We prayed and it wasn’t that kind of pray where you sit quietly and ask for God to help, it was the kind of pray where you fall to your knees and yell to the lord and cry out in hopes that he gives him another chance at life. I had even called a funeral home to see what their protocol was for taking someone who was positive. By the grace of god, our prayers were heard and my father-in-law was given another chance at life. My husband and I dropped him off at the ER after his 3 day fever wouldn’t break, we left with the intention of being back maybe after two days to pick him up. Within less than an hour of dropping him off at the ER he was admitted into ICU and put on a ventilator. He’s been hospitalized for two months with the majority of his time being spent in ICU. He later made enough progress to be moved to PCU. Yesterday we received good news and he has been accepted for rehab! While he was in ICU the only movement he did was when doctors and nurses would prone him so he became very weak. He’s made a lot of progress and is able to stand with the help of two nurses. With the help of rehab he will one day stand on his own. We now need help to cover some costs and financially help my mother-in-law who has been out of work since Washington’s stay at home order was put in place. Since my father-in-law will need full time care after he is discharged from rehab she won’t be able to go back to work. We are asking that you give us any help you can. Anything helps, even a prayer. Thank you for taking the time to read this. We appreciate any help we get.    strong Spanish:  /strong Este es mi suegro Inocencio Valverde y covid-19 debería haber sido su causa de muerte. Sin embargo, es un hombre fuerte que peleo una buena pelea y gano. Los médicos y las enfermeras realmente no pensaron que lo iba a lograr. Nos dijeron que sus posibilidades de supervivencia eran menos de un 10 por ciento. La muerte estaba sosteniendo su mano y todo lo que podíamos hacer era rezar. Oramos y no fue ese tipo de oración donde te sientas en silencio y le pides ayuda a Dios, fue la clase de oración donde caes de rodillas y le gritas al señor con la esperanza de que él le dé otra oportunidad de vida. Incluso había llamado a una funeraria para ver cuál era su protocolo para llevar a alguien que fuera positivo. Por la gracia de Dios, nuestras oraciones fueron escuchadas y mi suegro tuvo otra oportunidad de vivir. Mi esposo y yo lo dejamos en la sala de emergencias después de que su fiebre de 3 días no se le bajaba, nos fuimos con la intención de regresar quizás después de dos días para recogerlo. En menos de una hora de dejarlo en la sala de emergencias, fue admitido a cuidado intensivo y le pusieron un ventilador. Ha estado hospitalizado durante dos meses y la mayor parte de su tiempo lo pasó en cuidado intensivo. Cuando se recuperó lo suficiente lo movieron a cuidado progresivo. ¡Ayer recibimos buenas noticias y ha sido aceptado para rehabilitación! Mientras estaba en cuidado intensivo el único movimiento que hizo fue cuando los médicos y las enfermeras lo acostaban de pecho y se debilitó mucho. Ha progresado mucho y puede ponerse de pie con la ayuda de dos enfermeras. Con la ayuda de la rehabilitación, esperemos que puedo pararse el solo. Ahora necesitamos ayuda para cubrir algunos gastos y ayudar económicamente a mi suegra, que ha estado sin trabajo desde que el estado de Washington puso la orden de quedarse en casa. Como mi suegro necesitará ayuda de tiempo completo después de que le den de alta de la rehabilitación, no podrá volver a trabajar mi suegra. Le pedimos que nos brinde toda la ayuda que pueda. Cualquier cosa ayuda, incluso una oración. Gracias por tomarse el tiempo de leer esto. Agradecemos cualquier ayuda que recibamos.  ',\n",

I don\\'t know how/where I got it, and honestly it doesn\\'t matter. By that time, it was all around us, we just didn\\'t know it. My first symptoms were gastrointestinal. At that time, GI symptoms weren\\'t really on our radar for COVID, so who knows how many people I exposed to the virus. I continued to interact with family/friends/coworkers/public because I felt fine. On February 26th, I took my dad shopping and was in a closed car with him. By some miracle, he did not get sick. On February 27, I noticed an odd sore throat and headache while I was at work. I came home and by time I was able to get in bed, I was feverish, shaking, shivering and had the worst body/muscle aches I\\'d ever had. At this point there were still no documented cases in DG County and I didn\\'t think I could be the first so I kept trying to convince myself it was something else.   The following week I had severe body aches, fatigue, extreme lethargy and malaise and was unable to return to work. THANK GOODNESS. Sometime late that week, the coughing started. It was a dry, persistent, cough that lasted almost 3 weeks and caused me to fracture 3 ribs. At this point, protocol was that you couldn\\'t be tested unless you were being hospitalized.   I kept convincing myself that \"I wasn\\'t sick enough\" to go to the hospital. One night I woke up completely panicked with an unfamiliar feeling. It took me just a few seconds to realize that I felt like I was suffocating. I could not get a full breath. I ran outside and the cold air helped a bit, but I knew I needed help so I drove to the ER. When I got there, my breathing was a little better, and the ER was absolutely packed, so I convinced myself I should go home. I shouldn\\'t have.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/51847734_1602523909163806_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"51847734_1602523909163806_r.jpeg\" / The following couple of weeks, I struggled with labored breathing, intense chest pain, migraines, and cognitive issues regarding memory, attention and completing tasks with more than one step. April and May are a blur. We were working from home but I was still struggling with basic tasks, both because of fatigue and brain fog. June and July, I felt things improving a bit and thought the worst was over. My two noticeable symptoms were difficulty walking due to nerve pain, and coordination issues.   In mid-July, my job fell victim to COVID and at the end of July, I lost my health insurance.  At the beginning of August, a new set of symptoms appeared, but, at the time, I didn\\'t know they were related. In the last two months, I have experienced chronic shortness of breath, chest pain, debilitating fatigue, inflammation that makes it difficult to get around, swollen glands, rashes, intense joint pain, memory issues, reflux, confusion, incontinence, significantly impaired hearing in my left ear, and fuzzy vision.   Today, both of my ankles are so swollen, it is difficult to walk. and I had clumps of hair in the tub after my shower. I\\'m not typically a WebMD person, but in the last 2 months, at different times, I had myself convinced that I had thyroid issues, Parkinsons, dementia, and arthritis. I finally started doing some research on my own and found out that some people were struggling with these symptoms months after they thought they were recovering.   I\\'m now part of 3 different \"long hauler\" studies and am in contact with others that are also struggling with this. Without my two new blood pressure meds, my bp is around 190/120. My joints hurt daily and I can\\'t move without major stiffness. The shortness of breath continues. This week I had 3 decent days in a row. Today, it took me an hour to recover from taking a shower.  Little by little, I can tell I\\'m starting to improve. The mental fog is starting to lift, and I\\'ve realized how to challenge the fatigue, without fighting it (that doesn\\'t work). I have good days and bad days, but I can live with the symptoms. Some of my comrades are having small strokes daily, heart attacks, and are unable to walk due to muscle weakness.  My point in writing any of this is to say that we don\\'t need to live in fear. But, we do need to realize that although our community is \"open\" and life goes on, this virus is still out there. I was in decent health and had no risk factors and this virus has ravaged my body and seriously impacted my life. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE continue to be diligent about protecting yourself and those around you. Live life, but be safe.\"  Rachel Myslivy is organizing this fundraiser for Kristina.\\xa0 I live in Lawrence, KS, and we met 15 years ago when our kids went to preschool at the Little Red Schoolhouse in Lawrence.\\xa0 The funds from this fundraiser will go directly to Kristina to be used to pay medical bills relating to her Covid 19 diagnosis and living expenses related to her job loss.',\n",

       " \"Debra Crosby contracted Covid 19 in November of 2020. She needs your financial help to be able to afford Alternative Medicine, Alternative Healing Modalities, Services, Support, Prescribed, Organic Supplements and Organic Produce for the next 9 months.  Here is Debra's Covid Long Haul Story:  Because Debra Crosby knew that she had a vulnerable immune system she was extra cautious in terms of following CDC safety guidelines to the letter of the law in terms of protecting herself from contracting Covid 19. Even though she had always been careful, on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving in November 2020 she received a phone call. She had been informed that she been in contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid. \\xa0 Debra had just finished rowing on her rowboat in the Salem Harbor in Salem, MA that day. She had just recorded another positive message to be uploaded to Facebook about why she calls her time on her rowboat “ROWING for PEACE.” Debra knew that many people were suffering in isolation and loneliness during the pandemic and that is why she recorded a series of short videos filmed with her cell phone from her rowboat to help others find their own path to peace. Especially, during the pandemic it seemed paramount to Debra to get the message of peace out to folks. She still had her wet suit on when she answered her cell phone.\\xa0 \\xa0 By Thanksgiving Day, she had a full-blown case of Covid 19. Although her symptoms were pretty severe she was not hospitalized. \\xa0 By Mid-January 2021, at about 6 weeks after being sick with Covid 19, she had hoped that she was well enough to go back to teaching. She had assessed her energy was at about 70%. \\xa0She intended to get back to life as normal and make a positive contribution to her student’s lives. \\xa0 After only teaching one, 2-hour class via video conferencing she was debilitated for 24 hours after teaching.  Unbeknownst to her students, she could not function due to extreme fatigue. She also had heart palpitations, high blood pressure, spasmodic coughing, cramps in her chest, brain fog, cognitive difficulties, a very painful sore throat, terrible insomnia and constant physical pain that radiated from her lower back to the length of her legs.  Debra had none of these symptoms prior to getting Covid 19. Debra feels extremely tired all of the time and gets exhausted easily. \\xa0Sometimes it takes intense focus and will power just for Debra to move out of bed. This is not laziness and nor is it depression. When this happens she literally cannot move and she has felt trapped inside her own body. \\xa0 Because she has a strong work ethic, a passion for teaching, a devotion to her students and a love for telling inspirational, stories or uplifting messages, she thought she could just push through, persevere and “pull herself up by her bootstraps” to summon the strength to work. \\xa0 Within 2 weeks of trying to go back to work, even on a bare bones, minimal scale, Debra ended up in the emergency room twice. \\xa0 On February 5th, 2021 after the 2nd visit to the Emergency Room Debra came to the humbling conclusion her body and brain were not ready for work. While hooked up to an EKG machine in the hospital in Beverly, MA due to horrible, painful cramps in her chest, she surrendered to the fact that she was now a Post Covid Long Hauler. This was not an easy thing to accept, but Debra had no choice. She has had to let go of the idea of working. Her body and brain cannot handle it. \\xa0 As a self-employed educator, the last semester that she made income from teaching classes was in early October 2020. By mid-March 2021 it has already been over 5 months since she had made any income from teaching classes and at this point Debra has exhausted her financial resources. This hardship is beginning to have a negative impact on her health and her outlook on life. \\xa0 To Debra’s credit she was able to survive all of those months without personally asking for any kind of assistance.\\xa0  Through out this ordeal, Debra is deeply grateful for all of the love, prayers, encouragement and Acts of Kindness that her family and friends were inspired to offer of their own accord. She was in awe of how a small group of her students, \\xa0friends and family rallied to help Debra as much as they could since November, but she and everyone else thought she would have been well enough to go back to work again by March of 2021. That is the challenging aspect of dealing with Covid Long Haul, it takes time to fully recover. This is where your help comes in. \\xa0 Debra is a proud woman and would much rather be in the position to help others than need to ask for help. In fact, over the decades she has dedicated her professional career to helping thousands to discover the confidence to succeed with performing, presenting, acting, storytelling, creative writing and public speaking.\\xa0 Debra has helped many, many talented individuals launch their acting, performing, storytelling and public speaking careers. \\xa0 For most of her adult life she has committed her free time to volunteering for many charities, not for profit organizations and religious communities. She also helped raise funds for those in need whenever she could, both locally and globally. Debra has literally helped others over the course of her lifetime and has always been happy to do so. \\xa0 Some of the organisations she has been involved with, supported or initiated a fund raiser for are: The Wang Center's Arts Can Teach Program, the Anti-Defamation League, A.R.C., Citizens for Adequate Housing, Catholic Charities, The Boys &amp; Girls Club, Girls Inc, The EADEC School of Senegal, West Africa, A3D, Inc, The Apollinaire Theater, the Mary Baker Eddy Library, the Salem Cultural Festival. Salem International Documentary Film Festival, S.C.O.R.E, the Plummer Home, H.A.W.C. and the Veribella Foundation just to name a few. \\xa0 Debra has spent much of her life being of service to others and helping others. She has always done so with a cheerful heart.   Now Debra needs your help more than ever. \\xa0 The problem is that because Debra’s immune system is incredibly vulnerable she needs the time, support and extra TLC to fully recover from Covid as a Long Hauler.\\xa0 Debra also has had a history of having extremely negative or serious allergic reactions to many pharmaceuticals. Although, the Covid vaccine could soon be made available, her medical team and alternative doctor do not think that Debra’s body can handle the vaccine without detrimental effect at this time. There is concern that it could escalate all of her symptoms and might possibly put her life in danger. \\xa0 What we are appealing to you for is a donation to assist Debra so she can afford alternative healing modalities, support, services, prescribed organic suppliments and organic produce. Debra cannot afford this without your help. \\xa0 Debra has been doing everything in her power to get well, including having a very specific organic diet. She is also taking clean, pure and organic, prescribed vitamins, nutrients and supplements to help her body heal, as well. Debra has responded very well to alternative medicine in the past and this approach to healing should prove to be promising. \\xa0 Interestingly enough, many Covid Long Haulers are actively seeking out alternative practitioners for help and many Long Haulers are responding well to these alternative healing modalities. \\xa0 We are confident that with your help Debra will be able to receive the proper care, organic produce, prescribed organic supplements , alternative medicine, support and healing services so Debra will be able to get back to teaching, speaking and rowing on her rowboat again.   We see her with her bright smile, warm heart and enthusiastic spirit ROWING for PEACE again; inspiring others to discover PEACE within. \\xa0 We invite you to be as generous as you able to be. Please help Debra get better. Show your love, so Debra can get back to sharing her love through teaching, speaking and ROWING for PEACE.  In closing, Debra has an amazing way of making people feel like they are seen, heard, valued, appreciated, respected and have a sense of belonging in her tribe, but more importantly being part of this one tribe called humanity. She is always celebrating how important Acts of Kindness are. If you are part of Debra's larger social circle, professional connections and/or you are part of her tribe we hope you will feel inspired to help Debra get well and fully recover as a Covid Long Hauler.   Your Kindness and Support are greatly appreciated.  As Debra \\xa0says: “From my Heart to Your Heart: Blessings of PEACE.”  She also frequently reminds us: “KINDNESS MATTERS!”\",\n",

As a result, he was placed on a ventilator for thirty days and was in the ICU for most of the time he was hospitalized. His wife, Melissa, and children along with friends and family prayed for a miracle after learning that Rich’s chances for survival were slim. Miraculously, Rich survived this devastating virus. However, doctors have advised that his path to full recovery will be a long and arduous one.

       " \"Jamie Martinez contracted both COVID-19 and influenza type A at the beginning of October. She developed cold-like symptoms on October 7th and contributed them to either allergies or a mild cold.\\xa0 As her condition worsened, she decided to get tested on October 9th to be safe since she is working full-time and has a young family to care for at home. Unfortunately, Jamie found that she tested positive for both influenza and COVID-19. She and her family began a quarantine at their home.\\xa0 Neither Jamie's husband nor son contracted either illness.  Over the next week, Jamie's condition worsened. She developed high fevers, frequent vomiting, and increasing shortness of breath. Her oxygen saturation at home was dropping from 92% to 86% on room air. She was reluctant to go into the hospital because she knew it would be expensive and she would have to be separated from her family. She was encouraged to go in by friends and family, fearing what would happen if she didn't seek help.   On Friday, October 16th, Armando took Jamie to the ER at Baptist Integris Hospital. She was immediately admitted for observation and placed on oxygen therapy.\\xa0 After diagnostic testing,\\xa0 Jamie received a diagnosis of severe pneumonia in both lungs. Jamie has been unable to maintain her oxygen saturation above 95% in the hospital without the use of supplemental oxygen as high as 35L on high flow oxygen and positional changes. She becomes very winded if she attempts to do anything, even talk. She is still hospitalized and has missed nearly 2 weeks of work due to illness.   There is not a clear plan on when she will be able to go home just yet but she very much misses her son, Camden, and her husband, Armando, as well as her family and friends.\\xa0 Doctors have not indicated what the long-term effects of this illness will do to Jamie's lungs but it is understood that she has a long road of recovery ahead of her. She and her family are asking for any small amount you feel you can donate to help cover their insurance deductible and weeks of missed work.\",\n",

He has worked throughout the pandemic, transporting and caring for COVID patients before becoming a patient himself in late December. \\xa0After being admitted to the hospital on December 28th with breathing difficulties, his lung function quickly deteriorated. He was intubated, placed on a ventilator in MICU, and given a 10% chance of recovery.  \\xa0  After being on the vent for 14 days, the doctors did a commando extubation and removed the vent. Because he is so stubborn, or such a fighter, he chose to breathe on his own and live. He spent another week in MICU then was transferred to another hospital where he was discharged a few days later.  \\xa0  We are grateful every day for his recovery, but Robert has such a long way to go. He’s become a COVID long-hauler, unable to work and care for patients and do the job he loves. While hospitalized, he exhausted all of his sick leave and vacation leave. He has no short-term disability benefits and is not receiving a paycheck. Currently, he is unable to perform tasks required to return to work. He is awaiting evaluation to begin physical therapy to regain his coordination and strength. There is no timeline for his full recovery or return to work where he can get back to caring for his community.  \\xa0  You don’t think of everything that comes after surviving such a crappy virus and situation, especially when you’re so grateful. But the rehab, learning to walk and use your hands, talking – everyday basic skills and then the life stuff - rent, truck payments, insurance premiums and payments to cover his enormous hospital bill - \\xa0it continues to take it’s toll on Robert as he tries to focus on recovery.  \\xa0  His last paycheck was Friday, February 26th and FMLA will end on April 4th.  \\xa0  Any donation is so very appreciated and a huge help to Robert in this time. He’s spent so much time caring for others in a horrible pandemic and serving on the front lines to try and save others. We want to help him now, and lift any of the burden we can for a man who means so much to so many.',\n",

Back in November 2020, she caught COVID while at work taking care of her patients. She was hospitalized for a month, undergoing dialysis and other treatments as COVID attacked her kidneys and lungs. In December, we found out that it also caused Congestive Heart Failure, in which she had to have 2 stents placed in the arteries of her heart. Those procedures caused her to have 2 strokes which caused the whole right side of her body to go weak and being unable to move her right arm or right leg. She was released to go to a great inpatient therapy program for a month and has been in an outpatient rehab since then. She is now able to stand and slowly walk with assistance, but still cannot move her right hand.

       " '    strong Hello, our family has been impacted by COVID. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for your donation. My husband Darin, my daughter, and myself were diagnosed with COVID-19 on August 02, 2021. It hit Darin the hardest and he got sick around July 24, 2021, and he ran a fever of anywhere from 100-103 for 10 days and during this time my daughter was sick the same time he was and I started having symptoms as well, I am rarely sick and rarely run a fever so on August 01, 2021, we went and got COVID tested and the next day our results came back and we all tested positive for COVID. On August 03, 2021, I caught Darin because he collapsed and he was rushed to the hospital where he stayed for the next 20 days. He was battling COVID Pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. During his stay, we could not visit and communication was very limited keep in mind that during this time my daughter and I were battling COVID at home. My daughter was extremely sick at home and probably should have been hospitalized but by the grace of God and many prayers she monitored her vitals at home and was able to avoid hospitalization. I was symptomatic as well but not to the degree they were. Darin\\'s health during the hospital stay was covered in much prayer and faith in God. During the hospitalization, they moved him up to high flow oxygen and he was varying at high litres of oxygen, the doctor said that the next step would have been a ventilator. On August 12, 2021, Darin took a turn for the positive! He started improving and left the hospital on August 22, 2021, with oxygen therapy and home health nurse, physical and occupational therapist. After being home for a few days on August 28, 2021, the home health nurse visited and sent him back to the ER for coughing and losing his breath, He was sent back home that evening after a chest x-ray to recover. After an e vist with his primary care doctor, he was put back on steroids, antibiotic and a nebulizer to help. He is recovering but this is a process that cannot be rushed. Before this Darin was very active and a provider Darin is self-employed in the construction business and all emergency savings have been used. All donations will be used for basic living expenses such as utilities, insurance, medical needs, prescriptions, co payments, doctor visits, gas and the very basic living essentials to pay the bills during this very stressful and critical time. Please consider donating until Darin can come off the oxygen and recover fully so he can go back to work. This is greatly needed all Daring needs to focus on is his recovery and as a family, we can focus on helping him.

I was diagnosed with covid over a week ago. As well as my 3YR old. It’s been really tough. I have asthma so covid isnt treating me so well. I had a scare yesterday and ended up in the ER. They were able to stabilize my heart rate and oxygen levels. Brought my fever down and calmed my cough attacks. Today I had a fever 102.3 and my oxygen levels keep fluctuating I’m  still really not doing too well. My sister in law told me about an antibody treatment. However without insurance it costs $1500 that I don’t have. The treatment will cut the chances by 87% of getting hospitalized or dying from covid. I’m not one to ask for help, but for my son and my family and myself I’m asking for help.    ',\n",

Josue is still fighting for his life but showing some signs of a possible recovery .  We have been hearing of these tragic stories ever since this pandemic started, but to see it with my own eyes and feel it so close to me has been truly heartbreaking.  Our family is praying and hoping that Josue can recover and can begin to pick up the pieces of his fractured life without Mileidys.      Our family has set up this Go Fund Me to help Josue and Adrian pay for mounting bills, medical expenses and any other expenses that the pair will need help with.  The road ahead for these two is without a doubt going to be very difficult,  Please keep this family in your prayers, and if you are able to, please donate any amount to help Josue and Adrian during their time of need.

He spent 13 days on a vent where the only connection we had to him was via zoom and calling the nurses throughout the day.

This has been a challenging month for him and all of his loved ones.  I am excited to say he has been off the ventilator since this past Sunday! Bless all of you who have prayed and sent energy to aid in his recovery!  He will be coming home as soon as today!

He started a new job right before being hospitalized and does not have health insurance.  We are looking into what avenues we can get aid with.  However, it will be may be even a few months before he is able to go back to work.

       " 'I want to tell this story because I believe it will help someone out there who has been hospitalized for covid or know someone who has been through it. Covid-19 is not something to be taken lightly, there are so many opinions about it whether people believe or not. I\\'m here to tell you it\\'s REAL and it happened to my mother, this has changed my family forever, here is my story:       On April 12th 2021 will be a day that my family will never forget my dad told me my mother was admitted to Unity Hospital with pneumonia and Covid those words hit like a ton of bricks my mind was racing overcome with terrible negative thoughts, with her underlining conditions the outcome didn\\'t look good for mama. Never did we imagine what would happen next. strong   /strong  Each day mama was in the hospital her blood oxygen level was dropping fast started out at 80% when she was admitted and was as low as 60% she was having so much trouble breathing and very uncomfortable, they were not allowing any visitors due to Covid which was the hardest on her and us, all we wanted to do was be there with her to hold her hand and tell her everything is gonna be ok. I know she must have been so scared without family with her.  The doctors would take chest X-rays daily, poor mamas lungs were covered with Covid, I talked to her everyday her spirits were high she kept saying she was gonna be fine but that didn\\'t help our anxiety. As days go by nothing has changed she still needs oxygen every moment of her hospital stay and every little move she makes is exhausting to her, at this point she can\\'t move or even speak to anyone its just to hard. On April 23rd we had a zoom call with her! The nurses set up a laptop for us to see each other and communicate. She was hooked up to so many tubes and IV\\'s but despite all of that it was so good to see her. Deep down all of us were absolutely terrified, we forced smiles so she could see us happy because any type of stress she felt would lower her oxygen even more. We hung up with her and I just lost it. I didn\\'t know if that would be the last time I saw mother.  Then on April 25th we got the call they needed to put mama on a ventilator  one of the saddest and scariest moments of our lives. She was having such a hard time breathing on her own. They put a tube down her throat and a machine was breathing for her keeping her alive, she was sedated and put into a coma. They give patients a total of 3 weeks on a ventilator before the family has to make the hardest decision of their lives wether to do a tracheotomy or let their loved one pass away peacefully. Every day we got a call from the doctor updating us nothing had changed, I can\\'t even explain how those 12 days felt, we were in this torturous stage of limbo where we didn\\'t know if she would come out of it or die. I threw myself into work which was the only thing that helped me if I would be left alone I would fall deeper into depression and have overwhelming thoughts I was gonna lose my mother to Covid -19 and we would be another statistic. Every time they would try to remove the ventilator mamas blood pressure would rise and she would become very anxious\\xa0 (typical for people who are ventilated) so they had to increase sedation and try again tomorrow, day after day we waited for good news.     span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\"        span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" The good news never came until May 5th when she was pulled off the ventilator ❤️❤️ crazy story: The night before she was taken off the ventilator me and my dad brought a photo board for mama to look at hopefully if she tries to open her eyes she sees all the fun memories of us as a family and that will give her the strength to pull through, it was a MIRACLE. My dad was there holding her hand as she awakens she asked the nurses \"am I in heaven\"? The nurse said \"no sweetie, you are alive, you beat the odds\"  mama said she remembers all the doctors and nurses cheering for her as she awakens, they were saying \" You did it Tracey, you beat the odds\" I have tears while writing this part. I can\\'t describe the feeling of being told your mom is gonna make it!!\\xa0 I couldnt wait to see her! She came out of her coma right before mother\\'s day, I can\\'t help but think someone was looking down on us! The odds of surviving a ventilator are about 14%.       The hard work is not over, now mama has to go through a grueling 7 week rehabilitation to relearn how to walk, shower, eat and perform basic tasks. Since being bed ridden for over a month and ventilated for 12 days she lost all her muscle tone. This is where the hard work begins for mama, I know she can do it, it\\'s gonna be hard but her will to live is incredible.\\xa0         She is at a rehab facility in New Brighton 10 minutes from my house, it\\'s so easy to visit her whenever we want. I love she is so close to me!  After a month and a half hospital stay and 7 weeks of rehab this is not gonna be cheap for my family. My dad is one of the best people I know and is the sole provider for my family and has been for many years, he is a great man and does the very best he can. When mama comes home she is going to need alot of assistance and home modifications in order for her to do simple activities, their house will be to be safe for mama.   My mama means the world to me and I will do anything for the ones I love,\\xa0 even if it means putting aside my uncomfortability asking for money. This is something I never thought I would do but anything will help my family get that much closer to mamas full recovery and a happy safe life after she returns home.❤️❤️  Thank you to all my friends and family for so much love and support during this difficult time in our lives. We had so many people praying for us ❤️ the love was overwhelming. I\\'m so sorry for the many people who lost loved ones to Covid -19 this is no way to die all alone in a hospital room without family, my heart goes out to all of you.  I AM PROUD TO SAY MY MAMA IS A SURVIVOR OF COVID-19!  ',\n",
       " '  On behalf of Susie’s family and friends we are doing this fundraiser…     \\xa0     The process of Kicking Covid has been long and so heavy for all of us. Many of us have watched Covid from a distance—we never thought that would be us too…     \\xa0     Susie was feeling unwell and went into the hospital to get checked after finding she was positive for Covid. Immediately they hospitalized her and things rapidly declined. Susie was put on a ventilator and placed under sedation 3 days later.     \\xa0     Susie has spent countless hours by the side of those who are hospitalized or who need care without ever leaving their side; the hardest part was not being able to go in and hold her hand, sing to her, and talk with her…it has been painful to not provide her with the same kind of support she so relentlessly gives to others.     \\xa0     Susie is the rock of her family and shares her care and love with everyone around her! She has been fighting hard and was able to defy the odds and make it off of the ventilator. Her 5 kids are pushing for and praying for her full recovery. Susie’s group share only covers a percentage of the bills that are beginning to pile up. The burden of care on the family is enormous even without the financial aspect being considered. We are grateful there is a platform such as GoFundMe so that all who have expressed the desire to help can do so!     \\xa0     We are all hoping and fighting with Susie! Please help us tackle the battle of the financial burden. No matter the size of donations, all will make a difference!     \\xa0  ',\n",

       " \"  Hi my name is Haleigh Champion and I'm raising funds for my friend Shaun Johnson. They were recently at the ER on 9/2/21, 9/6/21, and were hospitalized on 9/20/21, on the fouth floor of Baylor Scott and White Medical Center - Hillcrest for a period of two days, after a three week long battle with COVID-19 pneumonia that led to respiratory failure with hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and severe chest pain caused by heart disease. Shaun has lost 30 lbs over the course of these hospitalizations partially because their body is struggling to stay oxygenated, and labored breathing takes up a lot of energy, but also because of the muscle wasting occuring from laying in bed sick.         The recommended treatment for this is to stay home from work and school, get rest and stay hydrated, monitor their symptoms carefully, attend medical appointments and take their new prescriptions for lung and heart health, and to restart insulin.    Shaun is going to gradually have to regain their strength a small amount at a time, as for right now, a grocery store trip is not possible without pain and worsening symptoms that are concerning.    Shaun also has a concern blocking them from accessing health care services. Their car cannot be driven because it needs to be insured and inspected, and it has been flagged for towing by Oct. 1st @ 9:00P.M due to lack of registration.         Because of the severity of Shaun's illnesses, 5 immediate prescriptions are urgently needed, which Shaun does not have insurance coverage for, and the costs must come out of pocket now. The lengthy recovery period will require many follow ups for the foreseeable future, but the first is on October 7th. The need to reestablish car registration must be done by the 1st of October, so my hope is that we could raise the funds by the end of 7 days.         Shaun really urgently needs to have a safe recovery period, and deserves to have a chance at recovery with the proper access to medication and medical care from a physician. They are, at this stage in recovery, very likely to relapse if not able to rest and make great progress in their treatment goals.  \",\n",

He is down to only using 4 liters of oxygen and is going to be coming home in the next few days, but will be out for work for at least another month for quarantine and then however long it takes him to get back to being able to function.

       " '  We are raising money for my mother, Marty Graves, to help cover medical and memorial costs for my father, Michael Graber, who had emergency brain surgery in February, contracted COVID-19 in March and passed away in April after spending 5 weeks in the ICU fighting for his life. Since we can’t be with my mom physically to help her, this is a way for us to provide some support in this difficult time.     The COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands-to-millions of individuals and families, many tragically. Unfortunately, it has directly impacted my family, too. Shortly after relocating from CA to NYC for work in early March, COVID-19 turned NYC into a pandemic epicenter. As a result, my wife and 1-year old son, who were going to make the trip a few weeks later, had to remain in CA to stay safe. I thought my parents, who in their 70s retired in a small ski town in Colorado, were relatively safe there. It was shocking, a few weeks later, when my mother, Marty, called to tell me my father, Michael (aka Mike), woke up unable to breathe and was on his way to a hospital ICU. We immediately were confronted with the scary reality that both my parents, who are in their 70s, likely have COVID-19.  Marty, a retired elementary school teacher and cancer survivor, thankfully was able to recover from COVID after two weeks of isolation. Mike, was just recovering from brain surgery in February to remove a cancerous brain tumor caused by melanoma, was admitted to the ICU in mid-March, sedated and placed on a ventilator. He tested positive for COVID-19, had two types of pneumonia in his lungs and failing kidneys, but he fought hard. He fought hard enough so that Marty could call him via FaceTime on their 37th\\xa0wedding anniversary on April 2nd, a week after the doctors told her he wasn’t going to make it more than a few days. He continued to fight, but after about 5 weeks in the ICU with ups and downs, he tragically passed away on April 21, 2020. I, my parents only child, was fortunate enough to say goodbye to my father via FaceTime, and my mom was able to be by his side since he was hospitalized long enough for the COVID to pass through his system.  We are trying to raise $30,000 to help with the costs of my father’s recent medical bills incurred, funeral costs and other related costs to alleviate some of the stress on my mother, Marty, as she recovers from this unexpected tragedy and heartache. My father spent about a month in the hospital for the emergency brain surgery and subsequent recovery. We were so excited he was back home and on his way to recovery, when COVID tragically hit my family hard. If you so kindly feel like donating or contributing, we very much appreciate your help and we thank you wholeheartedly.\\xa0  Stay safe, stay healthy and please cherish any time you are able to spend with your loved ones during this time.

       " \"I absolutely hate having to do this, but 2020 has kicked our butts. In January I ran through all my savings getting repairs done on my car, followed by my husband Ryan almost losing an eye at his plumbing job, resulting in him going back to working at a local music venue. In February I was out of work a month from a severe respiratory infection. I got back to work just in time to get sent to work from home, for which I'm extra grateful, as my wonderful husband has been out of work since March due to the pandemic. Since March, Ryan had donated his time &amp; money to helping keep a local club night &amp; the local venue going, our second home (also his place of employment). We were finally starting to catch back up on everything, when at the end of September I stepped in a hole in the lawn &amp; managed to break my leg, ankle, &amp; rip those connecting tendons off the bone. I'm just starting to get the bills on the ambulance ride &amp; hospital/surgery (so far close to $2K). My short term disability ran out earlier than expected, &amp; I ended up getting reduced pay. I just started back work a couple weeks ago, &amp; was finally comfortable enough to start to add overtime to catch back up, when both my husband &amp; I contracted Covid 19. I have many underlying health issues, which is why we've been very careful, but it is what it is. We were able to get deferments on the loans for October &amp; November due to being out of work, but it's now December, &amp; with my current health, I just can't put in the overtime needed to catch up on everything, &amp; an unable to get additional deferments. I am also out of short term disability, so I can't even take time off to try to recover from Covid, but I will have to take time before work soon for physical therapy, which also costs money. Since about 12/4, I've been running a continual low grade fever, with cough &amp; sore throat, thankfully not bad enough to be hospitalized, but enough I am having trouble just doing my job (call center work). We need to catch up on our loans, put something towards rent, the medical bills coming in, probably eat, and cannot afford everything. Due to my health issues &amp; being in a wheelchair, my husband cannot go out &amp; try to find a job in the area. We just need help until I'm well enough to put in overtime with work again. We cannot afford to have the car repoed or be evicted for things out of our control.  Any donations will go directly towards loans, rent, medical/medication, physical therapy, &amp; bills, bills, bills.\",\n",

       " 'Richard and Joyce Tockey were diagnosed with COVID-19 on December 28th, 2020, and their daughter, Denise Wilkerson, was diagnosed the following day. The Tockeys were both later hospitalized, diagnosed with Pneumonia and were in AFib. Joyce was able to come home, but later had to return to the hospital due to a collapsed lung. Joyce was in the COVID ICU for a combined 14 days. During this time, Richard was put on a ventilator. Shortly after, his kidneys started to shut down and he passed away on January 14th, 2021. Joyce was only able to say goodbye to him over FaceTime from the ICU. Joyce is home now, but still recovering from COVID, needing 24/7 assistance as she has lost almost all of her ability to sit up, stand, or walk on her own. Denise is home and recovering as well. Richard was the main source of income for his family of 4. With the loss of his income and the addition of funeral, medical expenses, and further medical services needed to recover from COVID, the Tockey/Wilkerson family is in a deep financial and emotional struggle. Their granddaughter, Kayla and daughter-in-law, Teresa, have been working to take care of Joyce and Denise while they recover from COVID. Kayla has not been able to work her typical hours, along with the loss of Denise and Joyce’s incomes, this has caused a lot of strain. Alongside the emotional toll this family has already endured, they are now trying to find a way to financially move forward. They are in a position where they are having to sell their home, trying to find a way to pay for their Mother/Grandmother’s medical expenses, Father/Grandfather’s funeral expenses, and further medical care, bills, and basic living needs. If you are able to donate to the Tockey/Wilkerson COVID Relief Fund, your donations would immensely help this family pay Joyce’s medical bills, paying Richard’s funeral expenses, and selling their house and relocating to a more affordable home. Thoughts and prayers for this family are greatly appreciated.',\n",
       " '  Hi, my name is Rhonda Phillips. I have known Kevin since we were both 10 years old . This is my life partner. Kevin is 43 years old and although he does not want to ask for help I am asking for him . Kevin previously served in the US Navy as well as spent most of his career working in \\xa0aviation and as a semi truck driver . At the end of August of 2021 Kevin was trying to recover from covid when he was told by his employer he would be fired if he did not get back to work. Kevin was driving a semi truck over the road for a small company out of California and out of fear of losing his job he returned to driving although he continued to get sicker while on the road . When Kevin arrived home late on sept 3rd Kevin looked deathly ill and went to the ER . 3 hours passed and I was called by the doctor to inform me Kevin was a very sick man and would be having emergency surgery and if I wanted to see him I needed to come now and they let me back to see him a few minutes before the surgery. This was the start of a long challenging heart wrenching nightmare for he, I and our families. Kevin was brought out of surgery on life support with a less than 50 percent chance of survival. Kevin had a perforated bowel, was very septic and had pneumonia. A couple days passed and Kevin continued to decline and become more ill in the icu . I received a call from the hospital that Kevin was being prepped for another emergency surgery although the odds were still against him the surgeon felt he had to go back in as he seen something on the CT scan . Later we found out In addition to the perforated bowel Kevin also had a very large hole in his stomach and a gastric ulcer had perforated . This required Kevin to be placed on several weeks of nasogastric suctioning in the hospital \\xa0with nothing by mouth and to remain in the hospital getting antibiotics and trying to seal the hole in the stomach. The doctors were still not sure if Kevin would heal . \\xa0Kevin also had a 80 pound weight loss during this time due to malnutrition and being so sick while being hospitalized. \\xa0 After 47 days in the hospital, 2 major surgeries, recovering from sepsis, a collapsed lung due to pneumonia from covid and 2 different instances of being left on life support Kevin was able to come home however he has a very long road to recovery facing a lot of emotional challenges in the months to come as well as the physical challenges and of course there is the financial challenges he is facing as he will not be able to work for at least a year and will possibly permanently be on SSDI . I have applied to SSDI for him \\xa0as the doctor has recommended however this could be many months to a year or longer before he is approved and he will not have income during this time . Kevin needs continued medical care and assistance to the long journey he has ahead of him over especially the next year as we pray the Lord heals his body so he can prepare for another surgery to reverse his colostomy that was placed during the 1st emergency however he must heal and become healthy before this surgery can possibly be done in a year . Due to the high risk the reversal will be due to Kevins condition \\xa0he would like to do this at University of Birmingham to better the chance of \\xa0no complications however it will be costly . Kevin will need frequent monitoring with multiple doctors and labs as well as has a lot of medical supply cost monthly that will need to be continued over the next year . Kevin had no insurance due to the size of the company he was working for and the medical bills are very high as well as needing to come up with the Income for the 3rd surgery expenses when that time comes \\xa0. I had faith the Lord would see Kevin to get to come home and I have faith Kevin will regain his strength and mental and physical well being and make a full recovery. Any help towards the current needs Kevin is facing \\xa0and will be facing over the next year will be so appreciated \\xa0. If you see it in your heart to contribute to this cause to help Kevin through this I can not say thank you enough . All donations will be placed directly into Kevins banking account and will go to his medical expenses, doctor visits \\xa0medicines, medical supplies, follow up scans and procedures as well as hospital bills and / or any other need for Kevin that may arise as he faces this long road ahead of him \\xa0. If your not able to contribute if you could just whisper a prayer his way I also can not thank you enough on his behalf .\\xa0  ',\n",
       " '          I am starting this fundraiser in hopes of getting much needed financial help for my friend Heather and her family as they recover from the health and financial burdens of Covid 19.   Heather is a stay at home mother to four children, who she also homeschools. Her husband Micah is the sole provider for the family and is now unable to work due to complications brought on by Covid.  In the coming months they are going to be in need of funds for basic living expenses and any medical bills. I know they would be so full of gratitude and appreciation for any blessing they receive and more importantly prayer.  I have included their full story below.           On August 21st Heathers husband Micah began to experience symptoms of covid. Shortly thereafter their 4 children also started getting sick and then Heather’s symptoms started on August 23.  The whole family tested positive on August 25th. Thankfully the children recovered rapidly but Heather and Micah remained extremely sick and it was necessary for a family member to come help care for them and the children.  Micah started to come out of covid but developed serious chest pain resulting in a trip to the ER. CAT SCANs preformed showed significant pulmonary embolism with both lower portions  filled with clots and his entire left lung filled with 60+ clots. According to the doctor it was the worst he’d ever seen. He was hospitalized from September 6th thru September 14th. He is home now but is expected to be out of work for up to 4 months due to damage caused by Covid induced pulmonary embolism.              While Micah was in the hospital Heather felt as though she was starting to recover from covid, but was then faced with a setback of chest pain. Thinking maybe pneumonia was setting in or worse Heather went to the ER via Ambulance on September 11th.  A CAT SCAN revealed  she was also suffering from pulmonary embolism as a result of covid. An initial rapid test in the Er resulted in a false negative. She had a rough night in the hospital, her nurse was extremely concerned and requested a regular covid test which came back positive.  The doctor immeadiatly put in for Monoclonal Antibody infusion therapy. It was a lifesaver! She started feeling better after the first infusion. She was released from the hospital on September 16th.              Both Heather and Micah are home now but are both expected to continue their care with a pulmonary specialist.  They are currently home recovering on various medications and with the support of oxygen.   ',\n",

My father does not come out of the house since COVID started and he was diagnosed of COVID. My father oxygen level was gradually going down to the 60s \\xa0on a 10 liters oxygen on his 2nd day in the hospital. The doctor informed me that my father requires \\xa0a higher supplement of oxygen through mechanical ventilation like a ventilator or a high flow nasal cannula but there was no available equipment in the hospital and the other hospitals in town to use. I did not have any second thoughts \\xa0to come out of my way to buy a HIGH FLOW NASAL CANNULA \\xa0to save my father’s life. I managed to buy him a High Flow Nasal Cannula about 6 hours away from where my father was. \\xa0But unfortunately, the machine did not \\xa0make it to him in time. Philippines is a poor country. This machine cost $8000. \\xa0Not everyone can buy this machine immediately. \\xa0Until at this time, the stores that sells these machines are out of stock in our area. After my father’s passing, \\xa0I have communicated \\xa0to the doctors in the hospital to let the patients or any family member know that the machine would be available for someone that would need it. \\xa0My brother back home have been receiving many calls from family member in the hospital asking if the HIGH FLOW NASAL CANNULA machine is available for their love one \\xa0to use. \\xa0With no hesitation, we let them borrow the machine and it really helped the \\xa0patient recover from COVID quicker. As we all know, COVID are affecting many people globally. And I am sad to say that those people that are getting sick and not able to managed their symptoms at home ending up to the hospital to get some help but the hospitals doesn’t have enough equipment \\xa0to use for their patient to help with their breathing \\xa0and to \\xa0fight COVID. \\xa0I would like to help my fellow (kababayans) filipinos that are very \\xa0less fortunate and sickly fight and recover from COVID. \\xa0Buying few more machines and have them available with your generous donations will help anyone in need and would save so many lives. I thank you in advance wholeheartedly and God will bless you thousand folds. Thank you!  ',\n",

       " '  Hi,    I am setting this up for a friend who is currently hospitalized with Covid 19 pneumonia. She has been in the hospital for about 9 days so far. She is still on too much oxygen to be able to leave and cannot move. She was finally able to text this evening (after 3 excruciating days of radio silence) and when I asked what I could do to help, all she said was financial assistance. She is a single mom. She is the primary caretaker of her two elderly parents. (Her father passed away from Covid earlier this month). She has two family members who were able to come in from out of town to assist with child care and help make arrangements for her father. She works as a contractor, so she has no paid time off other than the required accrual of 1 week sick leave over a year (I estimate she has about 2 days of sick leave based on her start date). She does pay for disability, but it won\\'t kick in for a while still, and will only be a partial replacement of her salary. She carries the burden of full financial responsibility for her household and soon will also have to carry her entire insurance premium on her own since she is unable to work.  Additionally, the insurance plan is one with a very high deductible. I could go on, but you all see how her finances are going to get out of control very quickly.     I\\'m asking for you to please donate anything you can. She has reached out to me 3 times since her hospitalization and all three times her biggest stressor is financial. \"I can\\'t breath, can you help me figure out what kind of benefits I can get through work\". \"I have Covid pneumonia and I can\\'t move. Do you know if there is any assistance out there to help pay my mortgage next month\". I want to at least get her to a place where she can remove finances off of her plate as her primary stressor.

He was hospitalized into the ICU due to severe breathing problems at home while in quarantine and unfortunately a few days later he was put on a ventilator. He was on the ventilator for over a month, and battled pneumonia during this time as well.   The days seem to run together, having to constantly call and get updates from the nurses and doctors. It’s been a roller coaster ride, some days they would tell us he was ok and other days he was very close to passing away but miraculously made it to another day.    He finally managed to open his eyes after the doctors told us he would never be able to wake up or come off the ventilator. If you know my Dad, you know he’s a good person, fighter, extremely hard worker and he is still fighting to come home to his family and friends.   As of today, it is day 52 of him being in the hospital and we still cannot see him in person but he is making slow progress. However, he is nowhere near ready to come home and is going to need at least a year of physical and respiratory therapy. Due to the amount of time he was on heavy sedation and paralyzing medications, he is not able to move much because his body is really weak. He was the sole provider at home for my mom and younger brother and will not be able to return to his job.   My dad is the most loving, kind-hearted human being and always helped those in need when he could. This was his WORST fear, and it came true.   Many of you have asked us if you can help and we are very appreciative of your kind hearts and have created this account. All of the money raised will be used to help with the bills my mom and us are encountering while my dad is recovering at the hospital/ therapy facility.   Thank you all so much for your prayers, we are forever grateful for them and cannot express that enough in words! Anything helps, even a share.   If you have any questions, you can reach out to any of us.    Hola familia y amigos  Como muchos de ustedes saben, mi papá, Fernando Rodríguez dio positivo por COVID-19 durante el mes de junio. Fue hospitalizado en la UCI debido a graves problemas respiratorios en casa mientras estaba en cuarentena y, desafortunadamente, unos días después le pusieron un ventilador. Estuvo en el ventilador durante más de un mes y también luchó contra la neumonía durante este tiempo.  Los días parecen correr juntos, teniendo que llamar constantemente y recibir actualizaciones de las enfermeras y los médicos. Ha sido una montaña rusa, algunos días nos decían que estaba bien y otros días que estaba muy cerca de morir, pero milagrosamente llegó a otro día.   Finalmente logró abrir los ojos después de que los médicos nos dijeron que nunca podría despertarse o desconectarse del ventilador. Si conoces a mi papá, sabes que es una buena persona, un luchador, un trabajador extremadamente duro y que todavía está luchando por volver a casa con su familia y amigos.   A partir de hoy, es el día 52 de su internación en el hospital y todavía no podemos verlo en persona, pero está progresando lentamente. Sin embargo, no está listo para volver a casa y necesitará al menos un año de fisioterapia y terapia respiratoria. Debido a la cantidad de tiempo que estuvo bajo fuertes sedaciones y medicamentos paralizantes, no puede moverse mucho porque su cuerpo está muy débil. Él era el único proveedor en casa para mi mamá y mi hermano menor y no podrá regresar a su trabajo.  Mi padre es el ser humano más cariñoso y bondadoso y siempre ayudó a los necesitados cuando pudo. Este fue su PEOR miedo, y se hizo realidad.  Muchos de ustedes nos han preguntado si pueden ayudar y estamos muy agradecidos por sus amables corazones y hemos creado esta cuenta. Todo el dinero recaudado se utilizará para ayudar con las facturas que afrontamos mi mamá y nosotros mientras mi papá se recupera en el hospital / centro de terapia.  ¡Muchas gracias a todos por sus oraciones, estaremos eternamente agradecidos por ellas y no podemos expresarlo con palabras! Cualquier cosa ayuda, incluso compartir el post.  Si tiene alguna pregunta, puede comunicarse con cualquiera de nosotros  ',\n",

Unfortunately, this close-knit, multigenerational family has been left devastated due to impacts of Covid 19. /strong   Rina Martinez, Matriarch of the family, was admitted to the ICU and has been supported by a ventilator for the past 2 weeks. Fully sedated and intubated, the family can only speak to her with the assistance of the attending medical team through Facetime. She has begun a trial of new vaccines that will hopefully increase her oxygen saturation enough for her to breathe on her own in the near future. Rina’s husband Jose Martinez, was hospitalized from Covid 19 several days after she was admitted. Low oxygen levels, complications from a recent heart attack, and ongoing liver disease have kept Jose under constant observation.  In the midst of the two hospitalizations, the family also lost two Grandparents living in the home. Tragically Rina’s father, Jose Gumercindo Soriano Crespin De Ramirez, fell ill from a heart attack and passed away in granddaughter Alba Ramirez’s arms. Days later Jose’s mother, María Elvia Berrios De Quiros, suffered a fall in the hospital where she was being treated for Covid, and died from her injury.  All other members of the Martinez-Ramiez family/household have tested positive for Covid-19, and continue to stay quarantined together in their home. Alba Ramirez (age 28), continues to be a source of strength and support for her younger siblings Jenny 20), Javier (age 11), Ezequiel (age 14), and nephew Samir (age1), as she and her aunt Claribel continue to suffer symptoms of the virus.  As long as I’ve know this family, they have always helped those in need. They are very involved in their community, working very closely with St. Gabriel Catholic Church on my of their drives and events. Feeding and clothing the less fortunate, this family is constantly placing the needs of others before themselves. As we all know, medical expenses, living expenses, and funerals in the United States can be extremely costly. This fundraiser has been established to help ease the burden on Alba and her family, so they can focus on healing and properly mourning their loved ones.  Please feel free to share this fundraising effort with your families and friends, even if they personally do not know the Martinez-Ramirez. Any donations that you are able to provide will greatly help this wonderful family. We understand that some of you may be going through financial difficulties as well, your assistance in the form of daily prayers and well wishes will be more than welcome and strongly encouraged.  Thank you, truly from the bottom of all our hearts.',\n",
       " 'The Leontyuk family has been severely impacted by COVID-19 and needs your help.\\xa0  Ivan and his wife Mariya, as well as their daughter Alla, tested positive for COVID-19 the beginning of April. They all live in the same home, along with Alla’s husband Mike. Mariya fought the devastating illness from home while Ivan and Alla were hospitalized. Ivan and Alla needed ventilators and Alla was put into a medically-induced coma for 10 days. On April 16, after 12 days in the hospital, Ivan passed away. A small service was held for him on April 23.  Alla is now recovering at home. She is very weak and requires oxygen to help her breathe. Mariya is also recovering from the virus and has taken unpaid leave from work to take care of Alla.  Alla’s husband Mike was able to quarantine himself in another area of the home and has tested negative for the virus. He will be starting back to work at the end of April.  Ivan and Mariya were together for more than 40 years. When Ivan was paralyzed from a car accident three years ago, Alla became his caregiver. The family is an active part of the Ukrainian Bible Church in Fairview and Alla looks forward to returning to her missionary work helping children in Honduras when she is able.  Mariya and Mike are both janitors for Relay Resources. Mariya has been with the organization for over 20 years, currently cleaning at a 911 call center, while Mike helps cover at multiple locations as needed.  The family is very grateful for the love and support of their friends and family. Flowers and food left at their doorstep have been welcome blessings in this time of recovery. Mariya is also thankful that she and Alla are able to be with each other through this.\\xa0  Your donation will help the family cover bills and mortgage payments while they focus on recovery during this difficult time.',\n",

Several members have been hospitalized and now have covid pneumonia. I’m sure most of you know my grandma Joan Bolton, my uncle Darold Swanson and my aunt Linda Snellgrove.

       " \"  Hi y'all,          In late August, my family and I contracted COVID-19. In early September, my mom and I both progressed into a more severe case and were hospitalized with COVID-19 Pneumonia. Mom was admitted in the hospital on September 6th, and was in a regular room for 10 days. Shortly after Mom was admitted, I was admitted on September 8th into ICU for 6 days, I was then downgraded to a regular room for 4 days. We were both discharged out of the hospital on oxygen and still requiring care. While we were in the hospital, bills continued to stack up. Once released, we were faced with financial hardship, that has been a constant struggle since the loss of my father in December of 2017. Both of us lost a months worth of income due to our extended hospital stay. My sister and I created this GoFundMe page so that my Mom and I can get caught up on our bills. Anything helps and will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for helping us out, God Bless!  \",\n",

       " 'Minda Baranda joined Our Lord on the morning of November 5, 2020 at the age of 65 due to complications related to COVID-19. After contracting the virus, she was hospitalized at St. Barnabas for over two weeks. Her condition worsened to critical in the ICU and she ultimately had to be put on a ventilator. As much as Minda wanted to stay with us and fought so hard to do so, her body could no longer fight.  Minda was a wonderful wife to her husband Silverio “Boyong” for 39 years, a proud and loving mother to three children: Paul, Chiara “Cha Cha”\\xa0(†)\\xa0and Jennifer, sister to six siblings and friend to many. Minda meaningfully touched the lives of those around her. She had a vibrant spirit that could light up a room, and she went out of her way to support those she loved. Minda treated everyone like family, making sure you were always comfortable (and always had something to eat). I think everyone who was lucky enough to know her shared the same feelings of love, devotion, and admiration toward her. We are all devastated by Minda’s passing.  Many have asked how they can help the family in this difficult time. Your prayers and support have been so important along the way of this horrific journey. In lieu of flowers, a financial gift to aid in the hospital expenses and Minda’s final resting place would be a great help to the Baranda family, who has been through so much. Minda will be buried in Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, NJ, just a short distance from her daughter Chiara.  Details of visitation and funeral arrangements will be shared shortly. For those who wish to participate but are unable to attend in person, a live stream via Zoom will be available.  For those who do not know me, my name is Skylar and I am Paul’s girlfriend. I am so grateful to have gotten to know Minda over the past five years, but I am heartbroken to have not had more time with her. The family does not typically ask for help, but I want Minda to know I will take care of her son, as well as Jennifer and Boyong, for the rest of my life.  I have asked Nikki Nueva to help coordinate this. Nikki was like another daughter to Minda.

This Go Fund Me was set up to relieve some of the financial stress from the family, as Rene is not able to work full time. Any donation amount will be greatly appreciated and would mean the world to Jen, Rene and their soon to be 5 children.     Jen is a selfless individual that truly cares for the well being of everyone around her. It is time to come together and show Jen what she and her family means to US.

       " '          Kade was diagnosed with Covid on November 7. She wasn’t feeling terribly aside from simultaneously having a double ear infection. Brielle got all of that as well - so Kade couldn’t work - and Brielle needed constant attention! Brielle also came down with a stomach bug and spent a couple days vomiting.\\xa0 We left Grayling for our family Thanksgiving trip to Kissimmee, FL on Friday the 19th which was past her 10 required days of quarantine. Kade still wasn’t feeling well and had been experiencing some mild nausea and vomiting but we had determined it was likely the same stomach bug from Brielle and that it would be gone by the time we reached the sunshine state. It was a long long long drive down with countless stops on the side of the expressway. Severe incessant vomiting and agonizing stomach cramps! We arrived in Florida for vacation on Sunday. By Sunday evening, Kade was hospitalized. After a day without finding anything - She was transferred to a new hospital so she could see a Gastroenterologist. She waited six hours after they said they would be there to pick her up before they got her a room. No pain medication, nothing!!! I called the floor nurse to check her status and could hear her screaming “help me!!!!!!!” The nurse on the phone said “who is your daughter?” And I said “the one screaming for help right now!!!!” After the transfer to a new hospital and being told it was “just Covid”, we found out she had a sepsis UTI and she started receiving antibiotics immediately. It took three days for her vomiting to get under control. She has lost just shy of 30 pounds. Side story…she one moment looked over at me and said “Mama, I’m dying!”               and I’ll never forget it as long as I live.                     Her daughter Brielle is six months old and Kade hasn’t seen her in a week. In addition to the physical sickness, she is devastated about not seeing her. Today we thought she would be discharged because the infection has improved - but unfortunately we found out that Covid is attacking her heart.                     She arrived without a heart condition and will eventually be leaving with medication she will need to be on for the rest of her life. They won’t allow her to leave now because she is at risk of having a stroke. Her heart rate keeps shooting up over 200 and stays at about 115. She’s had three small blood clots and has to be injected in the stomach with Lovenox (a blood thinner.)\\xa0 She is so concerned about her daughter that she is insisting on leaving against medical advice. The nurse told her “I am begging you not to leave. You won’t receive medication and you could die!”        They have to figure out how much Metoprolol she has to be on before she can leave. Her heart rate has to come down so she’s not at risk for stroke!               She had last week off for work, the weeks before and now this week, and some of the tests and the transfer aren’t covered by her insurance and she’s panicking. She also doesn’t even know if she can travel home right now - especially because we drove! I am just trying to raise money to maybe fly her home (if she’s allowed), cover some medical expenses, and give her some breathing room when she gets back since she’s missed so much work! She is a good kid who has to keep rolling with the punches and this time, she got knocked out.                     GoFundMe makes me choose an amount to set as a goal - and that’s uncomfortable for me. Anything helps. She’s spent over a week in the hospital and we are finding out so much isn’t covered. I know we can likely fight and get grants or something since it’s Covid but her being out of work for God only knows how long - (already almost a month since she was diagnosed with Covid until now!!) and the money she’s had to spend for food that doesn’t taste like old corn…and nightgowns for the hospital and medication co-pays…the hospital isn’t close to where my mom lives and we commute constantly - Kade\\xa0 didn’t have the money to start with! \\xa0I don’t know the amount, but I know she has a lot of financial burdens heading her way! And maybe with all of that coming, she could also use a day at the damn spa! Two days, whatever! She’s just a kid!\\xa0         If she can rest easy knowing she’s good for awhile, I could rest too!          I figured since this is some super bad luck, she is going to have some good karma coming her way and just trying to encourage it!            I’m always raising funds for everyone else - this time I need to do it to ease her!\\xa0        ',\n",
       " '  Being valuable and asking for assistance is hard for most people, and it is especially hard for  strong Ruben Diaz /strong , who prides himself on providing for his family. Ruben has had many chapters in life, and most of us have walked through them with him.         As his baby sister, I can genuinely say the last six years have been the BEST chapter to watch in his journey. He gave his life to Christ, joined House of Faith Bay Area Church, married Jessica, and became a legitimate bada$$ hardworking family-man. He was so proud when he moved his family into their 1st house together. I couldn’t be prouder of you,  strong  em Brother /em  /strong ! I’m honored to be an advocate for his health and assist in maintaining his sanity throughout this time.          strong  em How did we get here?  /em  /strong     Ruben tested positive for COVID on January 3rd. He followed the CDC guideline and remained isolated in home-quarantine for nine days with minimal relief to his various symptoms. Struggling to breathe, Ruben went to the Emergency Room on his daughter’s birthday (precious Isabella), January 12th. At that time, his body spiked a fever of 105, and his lungs were in extremely bad shape. The hospital staff ran a few tests, and he was immediately admitted.         Unfortunately, we would have never thought we would be where we are today. Ruben is STILL in the hospital and not yet cleared/strong enough to discharge. He is alone, missing his family and extended church family, allowed no visitors due to the current County guideline and spends most of his day thinking, worried and waiting...         A special thank you to his Pastors and Church for taking the prayer group to the hospital parking lot earlier this week.             img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62750263_1642747359614943_r.\"   /              strong HE IS CONSCIOUS /strong  and  strong ALERT, /strong  but it is challenging to breathe. He has completed all of his IV COVID medication but is tied to his oxygen tank. He still has a long road ahead to full recovery.  em When /em  he is discharged from the hospital, he will go home with oxygen.         We are hopeful that with the power of faith and many prayers, Ruben will overcome this speed bump. Being out of commission and unable to work since January 3rd, he had to cash out on all accrued sick time and PTO. In addition to health concerns now comes unwanted financial burdens and stresses. Ruben and his family do not need the heartache of fiances at this time, and his mind, body and soul  strong need /strong  to relax and be worry-free to heal correctly.         We are humbly and graciously asking for anything from prayers to any monetary value to alleviate the burden and allow him to focus all energy and efforts on his strength. The funds will be used towards rent, house expenses, recurring bills, and everyday necessities while he continues to be off work, hospitalized, and then adjusting at home.           Jessica, Ruben and their children appreciate the calls and texts. They are all read and reviewed with love; it is impossible to reply to everyone.

       " '  My name is Audra Buggs and on behalf of all my family members and the family of Taryn and Michael Higuchi, I’m asking for your urgent support, prayers, and financial help for my niece, her husband, her family, and her business.         Taryn Higuchi is an amazing young woman, who has worked tirelessly building her business – Taryn’s Tempting Treats. If any of you have ordered her scrumptious cheesecakes, eaten any of her mouth watering smoked brisket, or any of her other amazing baked goods and delicious foods, you know how talented and impressive this young lady is. If you’ve visited her café and bakery in Janesville, been treated by your business to one of her catered meals or had the pleasure of being able to grab her delightful treats at the Janesville Farmers Market before they were sold out, you know how much love goes into her life’s dream of baking and cooking.         Taryn runs Taryn’s Tempting Treats with the help of her veteran husband, Michael, who did 3 tours serving our Country. They do ALL of this by themselves.         They have 2 small children – Ava and MJ – who have this Auntie Audra wrapped around my heart.         Taryn’s Tempting Treats is this family’s main source of income and is in jeopardy of closing if they don’t get the urgent financial help they so desperately need.         Last week on Monday, November 22, both Taryn and Michael were diagnosed with Covid 19. Taryn was hospitalized and then was able to be monitored at home. Her oxygen levels were very low and are still being monitored. She has been extremely sick and unable to much of anything. Her fever finally broke, but she still has a long road to recovery.         Michael was hospitalized the same day and is still in the hospital. His oxygen levels have been even worse than Taryn’s and we’re still praying he will not have to be put on a ventilator. He also had several blood clots in his lungs. They have been administering blood thinners to break them down so that they do not travel to his heart or brain. We are praying that he will be able to come home this week, but he also has a long road to recovery.         They had to close down Taryn’s Tempting Treats indefinitely. They also had to cancel the 200 plus Thanksgiving orders and may not be able to do any Christmas orders, which accounts for a bulk of the business income for the year.         Taryn does not have any health insurance due to being a small business owner and the high cost of insurance. Michael has insurance on himself through the VA, but it is unknown at this time how much of the hospitalization, tests, procedures, medications, etc. that the VA will cover.         Taryn and Michael are in desperate need of financial relief at this time as well as continued prayers for a full recovery and help with their children once Michael is released from the hospital (praying he will be) and the family can be out of isolation.         So, we’re asking you to help this incredible family to ease their financial burdens as they continue to heal and hopefully return to and open up the business in the near future. They have both given so much to so many others and have worked tirelessly building Taryn’s Tempting Treats as they raise their two wonderful children – Ava and MJ.         Any support that you could give at this extremely difficult time would be much appreciated. Prayers, financial support for medical care, household expenses, and business expenses, as well as continued understanding of unfulfilled orders that many folks were counting on are desperately needed.         Please consider supporting this family and the business during this crucial time. All the proceeds will go directly to Taryn and Michael. If you feel uncomfortable giving through this venue, please message me and I will give you information on where to send checks, use PayPal, or Venmo.         Again – any support is SO greatly appreciated! I love this family with all my heart, and it’s been a heartbreaking week to see what they are enduring. Praying for healing, strength, peace and financial burdens to be lifted. Thank you all so much!         From the bottom of our hearts, we also humbly ask that you share this link with friends and family and, if possible, in giving (any amount will help).         We thank you for your support and God bless each and every one of you!!  ',\n",

We also invite you to consider a donation to help  strong Scott and Dawn  /strong with ongoing medical expenses and relief funds as they both continue to recover.     \\xa0     Scott has been in the hospital and away from his family and friends since October 27, 2021. That was when everything changed for Scott and his wife, Dawn. Scott was very sick and passed out twice at home. Dawn rushed him to Chelsea Hospital and had to leave him there. He was diagnosed with Covid Pneumonia, and in the next few days, Dawn discovered she was also Covid positive. She was able to get the antibody treatment, but seven days later was unable to breathe and was admitted with Covid pneumonia and a blood clot in her lungs. Eight days after Scott's admittance, he lost his father in Florida to Covid.  strong Scott declined and moved to the ICU, giving him a 10% chance of survival. /strong      \\xa0      strong Dawn was released after 11 days in the hospital /strong  and had to leave her husband without knowing if she would ever see him again. November 20th, the ICU Dr. called Dawn and said they would need to put  strong Scott on a ventilator /strong  within the hour if his numbers didn't increase and that she should come to the hospital. Holding to their faith and trusting God, Scott's numbers improved. Shortly after this, on December 18th, strong  Dawn's stepmom, Sharon, was also called home after a long illness. /strong      \\xa0     December 20th, the ICU Dr started talking about the possibility of  strong Scott needing a lung transplant, /strong  causing Scott to have terrible anxiety.

       " \"  Hello friends and family. I’m reaching out in hopes we can help a dear friend of mine. She is a beautiful Indigenous single mother with two young boys still at home, she has been doing her very best to raise her boys all alone. She is in need of some financial solidarity to help uplift her family during unprecedented times.     Her little ones became very sick with covid  this fall and one of them was even hospitalized for almost two whole weeks. As luck would have it, Christy also contracted Covid and was hospitalized for a few days alongside Matty. They weren’t allowed to see each other or have visitors. Unfortunately, there was no one available to help her with one son in the hospital and the other at home in quarantine.  She had no choice but to check herself out of the hospital. She works hard to support them the best she can.  However, due to the severity of their reaction and North Dakota State health department's rules, she was out of work for 6 weeks. Six weeks without pay and is now in danger of losing her and the boys’ home.          She an her children are  facing eviction she cannot get caught up. Christy isn’t asking for handout, she just needs help. She is a hardworking woman, and everyone needs help now and then.     Her birthday is next month and she is not asking for anything but to help save her home.     Rent is 1,200. For the month of October. I’m not asking for anything that goes beyond what her rent and utilities are. I’m sure there are other bills that are accumulating especially as we enter the holiday season.     It truly takes a village to raise children and this mother has been doing it all on her own for a long long time.     She is humbly asking for help after a horrible scare almost losing her child to covid.     if you can’t donate, please say a prayer for her little family and please please please share this link.

       " '  Hi everyone, I\\'m Jessica and I\\'m trying to raise funds to  pay for a Probate Attorney for my Dad\\'s estate. I have been trying to find an Attorney for a while now and it seems do to the pandemic no one has wanted to call me back. This week I was finally able to get an attorney to return my call and discuss setting up a consult and what will need to be done. She told me I will need to come up with $3,000 up front that she will put in a trust and will bill her fees towards. Most Probate attorneys charge $250 an hour so this is more reasonable. She said she will try to keep the fees as cheap as possible. Since I\\'m an only child and it should not be a hard Probate case hopefully the fees will not climb. My Dad of course did not have a Will so this has to be done in order to get everything put in my name. My Dad and I had an mortgage on his house and the bank is willing to refinance the house at a much lower interest rate but they can\\'t do it until Probate is done.\\xa0 span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" Right now I am behind on the mortgage because I wasn\\'t living in the house, my Dad was with roommates when he passed. One person moved out a couple months after my Dad passed away and caused damage to the house and didn\\'t pay the last months rent. My ex husband was also living in the house with my Dad and then he suffered a heart-attack, stroke and seizure and had Covid and my best friends daugther found him unconscious on the living room floor. He had to be placed on a ventilator and life flighted to KU Medical Center. He thankfully survived but was unable to go back to living at the house or to working and is now living with me, my husband and kids. I was able to put the house on Covid relief for a while but that has ran out and I am afraid if I can\\'t get Probate done I will lose everything. I can\\'t refinance or sale the house with out Probate having been done.\\xa0      span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\"       Update: 1/19/2022 I met with Ms. Urbom the Probate attorney and she took the documents I have and I\\'m to call her back in 30 days. Hopefully I can come up with the funds for Probate by then to get things going. She seems like a very nice Attorney and is willing to help me. I feel comfortable with trusting that she will be able to do what needs to be done with my Dad\\'s estate.\\xa0         This is what has been going on since by Dad passed away and why I am in in position now asking for help financially for attorney expenses.\\xa0          span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" My Dad passed away unexpectedly on February 27th, 2020 at Stormont Vail Hospital. Since then my whole world has just been turned upside down. I myself\\xa0 started getting sick in July of 2020 but just thought it was stress and emotions due to losing my Dad. I even started therapy because I was having a hard time dealing with the loss of my Dad. My anxiety was really high and I was having panic attacks which I hadn\\'t had in many, many years. I was throwing up some and I just chalked it all up to emotions. By\\xa0 September of 2020 I was seriously ill. I was seen in the ER but the couldn\\'t figure out what was causing my extreme fatigue, anxiety and nausea and vomiting. I personally just thought I was having a mental break down. I was having a really hard time with losing my Dad and I didn\\'t know what was wrong but I knew something was and I couldn\\'t explain it.\\xa0  span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" My labs look good and other than being dehydrated there was no explanation. They recommended I be off work and to follow up with my Primary Care Physician. Why Covid-19 being so high it made everything harder because of my symptoms. I had to be tested for Covid-19 to rule that out before I could see my Physician. I finally seen her and she couldn\\'t explain it. I was normally working 60 to 80 hours a week and had been doing so for years and now I would go to get dressed and I was physically exhausted. I was throwing up constantly and even hours later my medications would come back up lookung like they did wheb I took them. After several appointments and begging for referrals I was able to get in to see an Endocrinologist. I had calcification on my adrenal glands so my Mom thought maybe that was causing an issue. The doctor believed it was my blood sugar and ran lab work as well. At that appointment he put a blood sugar monitor on me. Within 2 hours my blood sugars drop to 50 and I had the hardest time trying to get it to come back up even after orange juice, soda, candy. I had no symptoms either.. this would happen\\xa0 over and over with no symptoms and drops into the 40\\'s even while I was sleeping for hours at a time. He diagnosed me with Hypoglycemia Unawareness. Then he put me on medication to take when I eat but that ended up causing me extreme stomach pain. I told him there had to be another option, there was but because I\\'m not diabetic insurance won\\'t pay for the medication and it\\'s almost $1,000 a month. I decided the best I can do it try to change the way I eat and do the best I can.\\xa0      span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" That didn\\'t solve me throwing up so I reached out to my weight-loss surgeon and was able to see her and she scheduled me for an EGD to scope my stomach. One of the other surgeons did the procedure and he found that I had a very large sized polyp at the bottom of my stomach at the top of my small intestine where they meet that when it would move just right would completely block my stomach and anything from moving through. This caused a me to have severe gastritis as well and was the cause of me throwing up and the nausea. He removed the polyp and it was sent to pathology. Pathology came back and it was non-cancerous. I was out on a liquid Medication to help with the gastritis.\\xa0      span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" That same month I developed a large lump in my right breast. My breast had became very sensitive seemed like almost overnight but I had been so sick I hadn\\'t even been doing my self check breast exams. Of course scared and thinking maybe this was why I\\'ve been so sick I reached out to my friend whose a nurse and she thought it looked like   span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" mammary duct ectasia  span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" \\xa0and told me to put warm compress on it. By that night I had ouss and blood like drainage just oozing from my right breast. I got up and called my doctor the next morning and they told me they couldn\\'t see me for a month, I was in complete shock. I called my Mom because I\\'m not driving due to my low blood sugars and she takes me to express care. They don\\'t generally do referrals but they refer me to the women\\'s center and put me on antibiotics. I finally get into the women\\'s center and they do an exam and tell me essentially it\\'s nothing to worry about they Dot believe it\\'s cancer. All the while I have this infection brewing and I am extremely prone to infections and have no spleen and have spiked fevers. I call my surgeon and she sees me and put me on antibiotics and I she calls the women\\'s center and tells them I need a biopsy done. I go back and they finally do a clip wire biopsy because the fluid is to thick to pull it out through a needle. The culture comes back as MRSA. This explains why I\\'m having fevers and not getting any better. My primary care doctor\\'s office gets the results and sends a referral to the infectious disease doctor but doesn\\'t put me on any antibiotics to help with the infection infection the appointment is over a month out. I call my surgeon again and tell her what is going on and she looks a the test results and orders antibiotics based on the culture. When I get in to see the infectious disease Physician he does and examination and continues me on another round if antibiotics. I see him for a couple appointment and he follows up with what she going on with me as he also took care of me when I was sick in a coma in 2009 and in 2012. He diagnoses me with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and said a lot of it is related to the severity of infections I have and the amount of recovery time and effect is has on my body. That unfortunately I\\'m going to be more prone to the MRSA infections since I\\'ve had them. That the only thing he can recommend is me trying to increase my activity 30 minutes at a time to see if that helps.      span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" \\xa0  span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" I\\'m still having trouble with nausea and vomiting and my surgeon schedules me for an exploratory laprascopy surgery to see if I have a hidden hernia or another issue that could be causing this. I have an out patient surgery and she finds a trocar hernia, lots of adhesions, my stomach is attached to my abdominal wall and a pouch had developed on my stomach that was allowing food to move there and just kinda sit there stagnant. She fixed all those issues and I was able to come home. Everything seemed fine that day and evening into the next day. By the next evening I started experiencing stomach pain that started to increase over time and my stomach had started to swell up and where my scar was from my spleen removal the skin started to look blue, black and green. My mom came over and stayed with me that night because I just thought is was pain from surgery but by the next morning I was in so much pain I couldn\\'t take it. When I woke up early she took me to the emergency room. They did a CT and found that I had peritonitis. Come to find out the area where the hole had been on my small bowl from my feeding tube in 2012 had been weak and it ruptured after surgery and all the contents from my bowels leaked into my abdominal cavity. They had to clean and scrape out my abdomen as much as possible. I had already became Septic and it had effected my kidneys. I was not doing well at all. They were trying to use drains to drain more fluid but it was so thick they were having a hard time. The nurse practioner that works with the surgeons office came in and reopened 2 of my incisions to allow drainage to come from them. The drainage was like thick slime. Then they sen me down to the cath lab and wanted to have another drain put in. Because I didn\\'t have a spleen a lot of the infection moved to that open space in my body. They put me on the CT table instead of the cath table to put the drain in. They gave me fentyl and Versed and proceded to insert the drain where my scar is under my left breast just below my ribs and I told them I could feel it so they gave me more, a lot of people go to sleep from just one dose. I was wide awake, they are still working on placing the drain and I still awake and I\\'m letting them work and they push further and I tell them I can still feel it and it hurts bad and they give me another dose. The nurse asked the doctor if they need to stop and he tells her no that I have a tolerance and they are going to have to continue. I laying there thinking are you kidding me, I can feel this and your not going to stop. I tell him if you going to do this hurry up and do it and get it over with because I\\'m going to need something for pain. He shoves that drain into place and it feels like I got stabbed in my ribs into that scar literally. Talk about pain! It was like some kind of new mid-evil modern day torture that I just went through. It was one moment I wish medicine had knocked me out. I was very sick\\xa0 and in a lot of pain and had to be hospitalized for a month. I was sent home with 3 IV antibiotics and 1 oral and with home health care.\\xa0      span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\"        span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" Within a week of being home a hole developed in my spleen scar and started draining lots of infection. My nurse reported it and it just kept getting larger and larger. I went in to see my surgeon and she said we would need to go in and open that area up and clean out all that infection and I would end up having a wound vac on that area. So she schedules an emergency surgery because of how bad it is and I go in for surgery. By the time she is done I have a hole in my abdomen that\\'s larger than a man\\'s fist and very deep. They admit me to the hospital and she places a wound vac on my wound. I have to stay a the hospital until insurance approves my home wound vac. I finally get to go home the day before my 40th Birthday. They continue me on with my same antibiotics and I\\'m still having drainage and sick and the antibiotics are now making it hard to eat because they are hard in my stomach. I\\'ve lost a lot of weight and am extremely weak. My infection control doctor is running weekly labs and following me as well. My nurse comes 3 days a week to change my dressings.

They can only reach one and they send it off the pathology. It comes back as a very hard to treat bacteria.

This really takes a toll on my body and I\\'m  span style=\"letter-spacing:0.0085px;\" \\xa0also falling here at home.

I end up having to go into the IV center to get fluid because I\\'m so dehydrated. The medication I need to fight the infection is making it hard for me to eat and drink. The effects is is having on my stomach is literally feeling like it\\'s killing me. After a month I go in for another CT and it shows the areas have improved. My doctor feels strongly that because there has been improvement and because of my unique situation that it would be optimal for me to stay on the antibiotic another month but he knows how hard it is on me. At this point I am having to take high doses of nausea medications and I\\'m very weak. There\\'s a chance the fluid could be residual fluid or it could be infection. If I chose not to continue I could be ok or it could be infection on come back. He leaves the decision up to me since I\\'m the one who is having to go through it. He gives me all the information and possible outcomes. I look to my Mom and and we decide with my history I better continue it for another month. This was a hard decision to make because this high of a dose is taking a toll on my body. We decided that splitting up the dose throughout the day may help with the nausea and vomiting. I struggled bad through that last month but I thankfully did and when I went it for another CT both collections of fluid we\\'re cleared up so it was a good thing I continued the medication.. I just had to continue with me home health wih my wound healing from hear on out.\\xa0 Had my surgical wound with the wound vac and the 2 openings that were being packed. Everything finally healed up in December 2021. I\\'m still trying to recover and very weak and fatigued.

       " \"  Dane is currently in the ICU, fighting for his life against COVID-19.         On October 13th, Dane tested positive for COVID-19. He battled a high fever and cough in the first days, which led to two emergency room visits, where they found Dane also had Bacterial Pneumonia.         Dane was then brought to a hospital in St. Paul on October 19th. He was admitted and put on oxygen immediately. He was placed on a high flow oxygen machine and steroids to help get his symptoms under control. Unfortunately, Dane was unable to breath without the oxygen machine and required a maximum amount of oxygen. After a week on a high-flow oxygen machine, he also required another full-face oxygen mask in order to meet his oxygen requirements and the conditions of his lungs were not improving.         After being in the COVID unit for 12 days, with no improvement to his symptoms, the difficult decision was made to place Dane on a ventilator on November 1st, in the hopes that it would give his body the opportunity to heal and recuperate. Dane has remained on the ventilator since then. He has been battling a consistent fever, but has shown slight improvement of his oxygen levels.         COVID-19 is a long road to recovery, and Dane will require a lot of care and physical therapy once he is better healed.         When we found out that Dane was being hospitalized for COVID, at the same time that Katy was about to give birth to their first baby, everyone close to them immediately wanted to help. The outpouring of love, prayers, and acts of kindness has been truly amazing. Dane, and his wife Katy, are the type of people who are more comfortable giving help than receiving it. Their kindness and generosity have made an impact on so many people’s lives. Their many friends and loved ones' lives would not be the same without either of them in it. With that in mind, we are turning our efforts towards financial relief for their family.         These funds will be used to directly support Dane, Katy, and their new baby Otto during this difficult time. All donations will go towards medical expenses, resources for the baby, and bills for the home. At this point, Dane has been in the hospital nearly a month and we’re not sure how soon he will get to go home. Once he does get home, he will require a lot of after care as he continues with his recovery. With Dane being out of work for the foreseeable future, and Katy on maternity leave, these resources will be so helpful in relieving some of the financial burdens of this situation. Our hope is that this way, they can focus on healing and being together as a family. Dane and Katy would be the first people to respond to someone in need, and we want to give them that same support. Dane and Katy have longed to be parents, we can’t wait for them to be reunited and for Dane to meet his son, Otto!         Every day of this road to recovery will look different, but the thing we want to remain constant is our support. Let’s keep The Tolzmanns in our hearts and continue bringing hope and positivity to their lives through our words and actions. We are asking for any help anyone is able to give and thank you so much for your generosity. Any donations that the Tolzmanns do not need or do not end up using, will be used to purchase gifts for the nurses and doctors involved in Dane’s care.  \",\n",

Rewind just a month ago, they had tons of plans but planning for a funeral was \\xa0certainly not one of them.\\xa0  Please, I beg… help lessen this anguish.\\xa0  We love you Tom    One of my best friends Andrea and her husband could really use help. Her and her husband both came down with COVID.

He has been suffering in the hospital since October 23rd, he’s now on a ventilator with an unknown future.\\xa0  While praying can help with healing powers it can’t help financially. Tom has obviously lost income while being hospitalized and will lose even more income god willing he recovers. Andrea has also lost income as she has not left his side. Just imagine losing a few months of income… most of us would be financially devastated.\\xa0  Andrea is the type of person that helps everyone yet would never dream of asking for help herself so here I am pleading on her behalf. Tom is a prideful man, he would never dream of asking for help either. He would give the shirt off his back to anyone who was cold yet stand shivering before he’d ever asked for someone to help warm him.\\xa0  In short I am desperate to find them some type of financial relief.\\xa0  Please help Tom and Andrea, the last thing they need is to worry about how they will make their mortgage payments let alone put food on their table once this mess is over.\\xa0  If you are unable to donate please share this and please pray! Toms wife needs him, his children need him and his grandchildren need him… please pray for his recovery.\\xa0 /font ',\n",
       " \"Hello, friends. It was not long ago that my friend and fellow musician, Lorenzo Macuja, and his mother were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized. Lorenzo has been on heavy amounts of oxygen and is still recovering from the illness in the hospital. Lorenzo's mother is in critical condition on a ventilator, and tragically she is now at the point where there is question if she will win her battle with the virus.

       " ' **PLEASE SEE UPDATES ON THIS POST FOR MOST CURRENT INFORMATION ON NATE**       Hi, I’m Chandra Christensen; sister of Nathan Christensen.\\xa0         Nathan, 25 y/o, was hospitalized with COVID Pneumonia on December 27, 2020. He was transferred to the ICU, sedated and placed on a ventilator on January 1, 2021 and is still currently in the ICU on a ventilator at Ogden Regional Medical Center in Ogden, UT. Although his condition is slightly improving, he has a long road to recovery.             Between two Urgent Care visits and hospital stays extending over the new year, he has hit two health insurance deductibles. Outside of medical bills, he still has his regular living expenses that need to be covered, which include caring for his girlfriend and their son. My goal is to assist him with the financial burden that he will wake up to when he is healed. Nate’s estimated portion of hospital bills are $14k.     My mom, Cristine Loll and other brother, Damon J Loll were also diagnosed and hospitalized short term/sent home on oxygen with COVID. They’ve since healed and are doing well.           Being that I live in Texas, I feel helpless not being able to be there for my family. Although they are not asking for help, I want to help ease the stress of bills as much as possible.     I also want to give a gentle reminder that COVID is serious and needs to be taken seriously. It effects everyone different. Decline in health happens so quick and it’s terrifying.             In addition to the 3 family members I’ve mentioned, several other close family members have been diagnosed with COVID but have been fortunate enough to recover from home with the help of steroids. This unfortunate situation was due to a VERY small Christmas gathering with immediate family only and it spread from there.             Please social distance to keep your family safe.    ',\n",

Heart attack, bulging disc, &amp; uncontrolled diabetes.  Diabetes caused severe nerve damage on his back and side.  This issue put him in extreme discomfort to even wear his shirt.  And made it impossible for him to work.  As anyone can relate, this caused great family financial distress.         2021, Randy was beginning to feel better &amp; was working toward getting back on his feet. Unfortunately, in late June Randy was taken down with Severe Covid &amp; placed on a ventilator.  Randy was admitted to the hospital without insurance.  We are working with the insurance provider to have his coverage August 1.         If you know Randy.  He has probably repaired your heat / air, helped you move, or repaired something around your house.  I remember Randy telling us he wanted to learn this trade to help others.  Heating and A/C is pretty important &amp; extremely uncomfortable to be without especially here in Texas.          Randy is a dear friend, who never knows a stranger.  And loves his family tremendously.  If you need him he is always there for you.         Randy has 4 children:  Kaston 25, Kade 24, Kesslie 19, and Kansas 9      please continue reading for the girl’s personal stories and experiences with their Dad           This experience, understandably, has put the whole family &amp; Randy's friends under great worry &amp; stress.  But in this direct impact of a Covid Crisis. We are simply blown away by our strength, as we bond together to get Randy well.  WE ARE DEFINITELY STRONGER TOGETHER!!!         On behalf of Randy &amp; his family, we are very grateful for your prayers &amp; support.  Please Donate, if you find it in your heart &amp; are able to.  Any donation will help and is extremely appreciated.         Kansas Story:    Kansas is her Daddy’s Little Kansie Pooh. She thinks the world of her Daddy.  We remember when she graduated kindergarten. She told her Dad when picking me up on my last day of school, “Can we go to Chick-fil-A to celebrate my graduation?”  After that let's go home and swim. Of course, he made her graduation plan come true.  As he was chuckling inside. You probably have seen her with her Dad, she has often been his work companion on service calls. She just loves to be with him. Right now she does understand he is sick. But it is heartbreaking for us because when the phone rings. “She is asking is that my Dad?”         Kesslie’s Story:    Growing up I was my daddy’s princess and he was my king. He did his best not to fail me or upset me. It didn’t matter what I wanted in life. Whether it be my dreams to shoot for the stars or a new barbie I wanted that week, he believed in me and he did his best to get it for me. Growing up my Dad worked really hard around the house, in the yard, and at work. He was the All-American Man. He could do anything and I mean ANYTHING. We wanted some shade in the backyard so he built a cabana. I wanted my own room so he built me a room in the garage. He kept the pool clean , he fixed holes in the wall, from the kids anger issues, lol. Just this past year he built me this incredible shelf.  I’ve wanted this shelf for so long but it was too expensive already put together. You could ask him for something and he knew just how to do it. With that being said, it is incredibly hard to know he’s at his lowest. The hardest part is not being able to see him. I pray God gives him more time and gets him back on his feet again. So we can have more time with him.    It would mean the world if anyone and I mean anyone could just pitch in anything, even a dollar counts. If my dad can get healthy and back on his feet.  The last thing he needs to deal with is added stress of medical expenses. So please out of the kindness of your heart help my father!!!  XOXO Sent from my iPhone  \",\n",

While we are happy to hear he is moving in a positive direction, we also know he has a very long and challenging road ahead. He has been told to expect a difficult and lengthy rehabilitation process of months, not days. To quote the doctor, “This is not going to be a sprint, it is going to be a marathon!” Since returning home, he has faced many setbacks requiring return visits to the hospital to rule out pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy. He is currently on oxygen and medications to fight double pneumonia. He will require weekly visits to the doctor to monitor his recovery.  Kara also had a difficult recovery from COVID-19. Fortunately, she was not hospitalized and is doing much better. Noah has also recovered from COVID-19 and has recently returned to school.\\xa0 Since Tracey has been home from the hospital, Kara has been providing 24 hour care and has not been able to return to work.

       " 'Our friend,  strong Aleli Basbas-Tonelete /strong  has been hospitalized since May 16 with COVID-19. We all know her by her bubbly personality and her energetic and lively spirit. Not only is she a great woman, the breadwinner of the family, a loving mother to Regis, and an amazing wife to Ramphie, she is also a critical frontliner during these extremely volatile times. As a nurse, both her patients and her peers are all testament to how passionate she is at her job and how much she cared for her patients. As a friend, she will always be the one pushing for group pictures, urging everyone to document every millisecond of every hangout and get-together. She will always be the first one to extend help and rally up the support and prayers of people around her whenever someone she cares for needs assistance.  Aleli was intubated and is currently medically sedated. Last June 26, after almost 6 weeks of intubation, her medical team and the family considered and moved forward with the tracheostomy procedure. They are also slowly weaning her off the antibiotics and the other medicine they were administering her. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has not only afflicted Aleli but also the two most important men in her life. One week after she was sent to the hospital, her husband, Ramphie, also contracted the coronavirus and was rushed to the hospital. After three hours in the emergency room, he was intubated and later on sent to the ICU. Their 19-year-old son, Regis, followed suit a day after. He was in the ICU on high flow oxygen for over 11 days.  This time truly has been hard on their family. We believe in Aleli’s might, the kindness of her spirit, and how strong she is to beat this virus. Considering the length of their hospitalization and the anticipated rehabilitation program necessary for their full recovery, both Aleli and Ramphie would be unable to work for a prolonged period of time. If she has touched your life or even blessed you with a glimpse of her sweet smile, we would like to ask for your help in rounding up funds to assist her family in shouldering their mounting household bills, hospital bills, and for Aleli and Ramphie’s eventual rehabilitation.\\xa0  While we understand that the pandemic has affected our whole nation monetarily, we need your help.

She went into the hospital 9/13 after attempting to battle COVID on her own for a week. Since she went into the hospital she has had many ups and downs but recently (on 9/24) was placed on the vent due to her oxygen levels not staying high enough.

So, even though Lawrence (Diannas husband) has not asked for help, I know that any relief in this regard will help him and our family at this time.

He was in the hospital for 50 days on a rollercoaster of treatment and recovery, dealing with pneumonia, respiratory failure, blood clots, unpredictable supplemental oxygen needs, and scarring in his lungs, all in isolation as a covid patient.     \\xa0     Every day my dad was in the hospital, he was leaning more and more into the Lord and trusting Him through it all, even in the darkest and most difficult moments. For the first few weeks, he was on high-flow oxygen and couldn\\'t speak easily or carry on a conversation on the phone. We texted him and sent video messages over Marco Polo to support him during the long and lonely isolation. He shared that there were many times he was reminded of God\\'s goodness and the hope that He gives us.     \\xa0     My dad was cleared for visitors on day 49 of his hospitalization, and my mom went to see him the next morning, day 50. She sent us a picture when she was with him, and it was so good to see them together after so long.  strong AND THEN! /strong  Not long after she sent the picture to our family chat, she said \" em Miracles are abounding today! I am bringing your father home with me. Prepare the fatted calf!\" /em      \\xa0     We all were absolutely shocked! It was only by God\\'s grace and a miracle that my mom was able to visit and then bring him home the same day. My dad has been home since November 19th and while he has been regaining his strength, gaining weight, and recovering well, a 50-day hospital stay takes a toll in many ways. The medical bills from while he was in the hospital, at-home supplemental oxygen, therapies to help recovery, and medications are all very costly. They have done all they can in paying these bills and, unfortunately, there does not seem to be as much financial aid as we had hoped from the government for covid-related hardships.     \\xa0     In addition to recovery and making sure all of the medical costs are taken care of, the house that my parents are living in is selling and so they must move by the end of February, which also has costs of its own (definitely not as much as the medical bills, thank goodness).     \\xa0     There have already been so many who have been generous with their time, resources, and prayers to support my family during this time - thank you!     \\xa0     We are so grateful for your help and contributions to help make this an easier burden to bear.

Before being diagnosed my mom was a very active person, always on the go and helping others. My mom is selfless she always put everyone before herself. She is the strongest woman I know and this terrible illness has made her bedbound. My mom would wake up early in the morning because she has always been an early bird and has never wanted to sleep in because she felt as her day was wasted if she did.    \\xa0   img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62310001_1640979449119868_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    \\xa0   img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62310001_1640979807555345_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 strong When it all started /strong     My mom was diagnosed on February 24, 2021. This year has been an unforgettable experience that I wouldn\\'t want anyone to experience. It all started with my mom having to go to the hospital because she was Covid positive and was not getting any better after 7 days she began to sleep more and refused to eat. It was then when I knew something was wrong while my dad was at work and my siblings couldn\\'t visit due to isolation I had to get my mom to the ER to get medical care. My dad rushed home from work and we took my mom to the hospital thinking this was COVID related and from that day on February 15, 2021, our lives turned upside down. What we were about to hear was something unexpected, something you wouldn\\'t want to hear or experience ever in your lifetime. At that time I didn\\'t know what the word CANCER actually meant or how the diagnosis of CANCER could impact a whole family and the person going through it. It literally broke us all when we heard my mom had a mass the size of a golf ball in her brain and they didn\\'t know what it was. By this time we were speechless hoping for it to be a removable tumor but it wasn\\'t. My moms journey began on February 24th and it took that long to get a biopsy because my mom was still testing Positive after a few weeks and no Dr. wanted to perform a biopsy while she was testing positive but one Dr. waived his rights and did the biopsy while she was still positive. My moms journey hasn\\'t been an easy one she has dealt with many health issues aside from cancer during this journey. She recently received a new treatment Car-T treatment. She is currently recovering from that treatment and is under care. My mom has been hospitalized since November 4th, 2021 due to her lymphoma growing and getting out of control she has been through several lines of treatment and it been tough on her and us her family. If anyone has had family admitted for more then a week you know how much work it is and how the nights are restless with nurses and staff walking in the room. My mom is never left unattended we have had some bad experiences when there is no one physically there by her side. Her lymphoma is causing swelling to her brain which doesn\\'t allow her to function as any of us would. She has no mobility at this moment and sometimes is confused leaving us with no option but to stay by her side.    \\xa0   img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62310001_1640979541345646_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     strong \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 ~~~~If you could please help~~~~ /strong     On top of being devastated with my mom\\'s diagnosis, my dad and I have to worry about how to keep a roof over our heads and pay for medical bills while we spend countless hours in the hospital.

       " '  The entire Tornell family is devastated and heartbroken by the sudden death of Kara Tornell, 46, of Des Moines, Iowa, who tragically passed away from COVID-19 after a long fight on December 22, 2021, just days before Christmas, leaving behind her beloved husband and soulmate of 25 years, Preston Tornell, and 7 children (Elizabeth (24), Abigail (22), Charlize (20), Charles (17), Braeden (14), Victoria (10) and Grayson (4). Kara’s mom, Carol, sadly also unexpectedly died from COVID-19, just days before Kara’s passing.     \\xa0     Kara had been hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 over Thanksgiving weekend. Her mother, husband and children also all contracted the virus. After weeks in the hospital, the doctors released Kara, who was elated to be home in time for Christmas with her husband and children. After two days at home, she fainted and was rushed by ambulance back to the hospital. She suffered a collapsed lung and was put on a ventilator. Kara, being the incredibly strong woman that she was, fought hard through the night, Preston never leaving her side. Her vitals showed signs of stabilizing and there was cause for hope as everyone continued to pray for Kara’s recovery. However, the damage to Kara’s lungs and pressure on her heart caused irreparable damage to her organs. After a long fight, heaven gained an angel on December 22.       There are not enough words to describe how amazing of a woman Kara was. She touched so many lives with her contagious smile and laugh, hilarious sense of humor, and unconditional love for her seven children and husband of 25 years. Kara was the consummate mother and role model for her children, their best friend and biggest supporter. She loved them unconditionally and raised them with Preston to be equally as loving, moral, and family oriented. Saying goodbye to their mom is the most difficult and unimaginable thing these kids will ever have to go through.     \\xa0     Kara and Preston each worked incredibly hard to provide for their family. Kara worked full time from home while also caring for her youngest child Grayson (4). However, Kara and Carol’s deaths have now left the family in a state of shock and disbelief, trying to process what has happened, and pick up the pieces of their lives without their mom or their grandma, and Preston without his best friend and wife. The family now faces a difficult financial battle, with mounting medical bills from Kara’s extended hospital stay and funeral costs for mom and grandma. In addition, Preston needs to arrange childcare for his youngest children, Grayson and Victoria, and continue to pay for ongoing bills without Kara’s income. Please help this family in need and ease their financial burden by donating to support Kara’s family. If you are unable to donate, please say a prayer for Preston and the kids and cherish every moment you have with your family. On behalf of the Tornell family, thank you for your support. Go hug your loved ones tight, stay safe and God bless.  ',\n",

       " \"  My name is David Brower , my wife's name is Darlene Brower we have been married for 31 years. Last October she came down with Covid 19 and recovered then in April of 2021 she got the J &amp; J vaccine and started having all sorts of problems , like leg pain and tingling to start with . Within three weeks she ended up in the ER with AFIB and was in ICU for a week during her time in the hospital she developed Neuropathy which just kept spreading . She has been in and out of the Hospital 7 times since then for her heart and other problems. They found a mass on her thyroid and thought is was cancer and she had to have a biopsy and a mass on her kidneys while she was in the hospital . Then they found that she has a umbilical hernia and fatty liver. After an MRI of her brain and back they found she has bulging disks in her back and arthritis.\\xa0 They have also now found a mass in her shoulder and she has to do an MRI to see what it is also .\\xa0 She possibly has an auto immune disorder but are still check and doing testing . She has developed Small Fiber nephropathy through her entire body now and she is taking nerve pain medication as well as other medication to help with the symptoms and the pain . SFPN victims suffer from dizziness and loss of coordination. Patients lose muscle strength, and reflexes which may begin to fail. In its cruel end stages, PN can cause bowels or bladders to “let go,” stabbing or burning pains, and electrical sensations that course throughout the body. Gradually, someone with SFPN can lose feeling in their fingers and toes. If that numbness spreads to your arms and legs, you won’t feel pain if you step on a thumbtack or get a pebble in your shoe. But missing that tiny item can eventually result in a serious, non-healing wound. Her autonomic nervous system has also been effected as is a component of the peripheral nervous system that regulates involuntary physiologic processes including heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and digestion     She could not sweat or tolerate heat or cold she was not sleeping more than 2 hours a day for months. She has lost 70 pounds and her hair has been falling out . Her cancer screening for colon cancer came back with a positive result when she was in ICU and now she is scheduled for a colonoscopy next week. They also just found a mass in her left shoulder and she has to now go for another MRI to find out what it could be the the doctor believes it could be a tumor but she has an another apt this week with the specialist . She has been very depressed and is fighting back as best she can and thanks god every day for healing her as much as he has . Until now she has been mostly healthy and has never been one to go to the doctor other than the regular checkups. She worked Three jobs one helping grandparents and other relatives get temporary custody of their grandchildren or relatives to keep these kids out of the Foster care system and the other also teaching parenting classes for court ordered cases and one as a Mediator . She has dedicated her entire career to working for the community and giving back. She holds a Masters Degree and she even volunteers as a guardian ad litim in Pasco County and has for the last 12 years . I am asking for this fund raiser because her medical bills for this year alone have been over $500,000 and we do have insurance, but they only pay a portion of her total expenses and we are still responsible for 20% and we have a large deductable or out of pocket expense as well . Some of the procedures they want to try to help with are not covered by insurance such as Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy and it is very costly $4500 for twenty sessions and they say it could take 40 to see a serious difference and she has to go every day for weeks straight so she wont be able to work during her treatment . Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) effectively heals infection by reducing swelling and increasing circulation. It does this through promoting revascularization – the formation of new blood capillaries. Once blood flow to the infected area improves, nerve repair and regrowth can begin. New nerve fibers reverse PN and relieve its symptoms. In addition, studies show that hyperbaric oxygen stimulates the release of stem cells in the wound area that differentiate into new tissue and nerve cells.     We have depleted are savings this year as she has not been able to really work and thank God for\\xa0 our Daughter Jessica who has helped with taking over for her mom at work and bringing some money in to the home . I know it is Christmas and times are hard for everyone, but they really believe that the oxygen therapy will help her and would like to start as soon as possible , and we just can't afford to pay for it. We also have thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills, and she is still going for treatment for all her other conditions if you can help at all it will be appreciated. Thank you again in advance and may God bless you if nothing else please say a prayer for her healing she has truly come a long way from when she was hospitalized in April, and we thank God for her recovery every day. We also thank you for anything that you can do to help us with her healing journey thank you again in advance it is truly appreciated more than you will ever know     Sincerely, David Brower  \",\n",
       " \"  As many of you are aware, my brother-in-law, Ed Rogowski has been in the hospital since December 10.  He was diagnosed with Covid that moved into his lungs and he was hospitalized with pneumonia.   He was placed on a ventilator for several days, but was strong enough to get off of that and be placed on oxygen in his nose.  Then, a bacterial infection developed in his right lung.  We had hoped the antibiotics would be strong enough to clear that out along with some other methods, but he needed surgery two days ago to help rid the infection.  Each day there seems to be a new hurdle, but we have faith Ed is strong enough to get out of there and back home to better heal and get stronger.  Once he is home it may be as long as two months for him to recover.     The medical bills are unknown at this time and his time off of work is becoming lengthy.  If you are able to help in any way, it is much appreciated.  I would like my sister to be able to be by Ed's side as much as possible without worrying about being at work to get bills paid.

       " '  Hello, my name is Chaslyn Drilling, and I got hospitalized from COVID-19 and pneumonia. I was not feeling well at the beginning of the year, so my girlfriend and I went to a clinic in Flower Mound to get looked at and see what was wrong.  After getting to the clinic, we waited for about 2 hours to get checked out.  During this time, I started feeling like I had trouble getting deep breaths in and was struggling to breathe in general.  Once they called my name, I went back to the room and started to describe my symptoms to the nurse, and she went to check my pulse-ox. It was 80. Usually, under 90 is already cause for concern, so they immediately told me I needed to go to a hospital.  Luckily there was one less than half a mile down the road.  After arriving, we went to the ER, where I got checked in got the care I needed.  I had an X-ray done on me because of the severity of my pulse-ox.  The doctors thought I may have had a clot in my lunge, but luckily, nothing was found there.  Shortly after the x-ray, they checked to see if I had COVID, and the test came back positive. I then stayed at the hospital from January 2nd to January 5th, basically bedridden until the final day, only really able to get up to go to the bathroom because of the muscle soreness from COVID.  They took blood tests every day. I was hooked up to an IV bag 3 to 4 times a day for medicine.  I took countless pills, and I was hooked up to an oxygen supply to help with breathing.  I also was fed by the hospital, and I\\'m honestly not sure if the food tasted that badly or covid took my taste away.  I could only eat fruit and drink water, so I was not getting all the vitamins I needed and lost 20 pounds while in the hospital.  On the second to last day at the hospital, I was tasked with walking around the room I was staying in to see how I could fair walking around again. After about 2 or 3 minutes, I definitely felt winded, and my pulse-ox was around 88 after the very mild \"exercise\" I performed.  I thought I did not want to be here anymore and tried to beg the doctor to let me go, but he knew better than I did and made me stay one more night.  The next day we did the same thing, and my pulse-ox was in the low 90s, around 91 to 92.  The doctor hesitated to send me home but said if I wanted to that I would need to take a portable oxygen machine home with me, and I agreed because I knew that would be a lot cheaper than staying another night in the hospital, which definitely worried me on the financial side of things.      Now at this present time, I am feeling up to 99% better with the occasional coughing, but I will gladly take that over not being able to breathe.  This whole experience was not one I had planned for but one I can not forget now.  This now brings us to why I sent up this page and the amazing medical bills that hospitals love to give you.  I am currently in contact with the hospital, however, and am trying to see what my financial situation looks like and what aid is available to me because I am not insured.  This means my medical bills are incredibly high and difficult to manage.      If you are still reading, I already can not thank you enough for just being concerned about my health and wanting to know what exactly happened to me.  I am a person that hates asking for help, but I am going out on a limb here and attempting to ask for anything that you can spare to help me pay for my medical bills.  I know times are incredibly tough right now in the economy, and I am not expecting much but just know if you choose to donate, I will be highly thankful for your generous gift in helping me in my time of need.  It would mean the world to me, and I pray God to bless you and your family for thinking of me.  If you can not give, that is entirely understandable, and I would ask that you would just pray over my finances and that God would answer my praying of ultimately paying off medical bills in whatever way that happens.     Thank you all so much for reading my story and learning about what I went through.  I genuinely love all of you and appreciate you so much. Blessing to you and your family! Thank you!  ',\n",

Long story short, Haley is currently in the hospital in Los Angeles being treated for a rare neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). This is a serious complication from COVID-19, which she tested positive for on Jan. 18. Initially, her symptoms were mild, thanks to being vaccinated and boosted. Several days later, though, she experienced a rapid onset of scary symptoms including paralysis, tingling, numbness and weakness. During her third trip to the ER this past weekend, she was finally admitted to the hospital. Thankfully, her mom, Lori, has finagled her way to be at her bedside.    \\xa0    Haley is currently receiving infusions every 24 hours and will remain in the hospital for at least 14 days. We don’t know what the road to recovery will be like or how long it will take when she eventually is discharged. While hospitalized, she is unable to work as a full-time nanny. Her paid sick days have already run out. And we know her medical bills will be significant. We’d like to relieve as much unnecessary stress as possible, so Haley can focus on getting better instead of worrying about mounting bills. The goal of this fundraiser is to help Haley cover medical-related expenses, including rehabilitation.    \\xa0    At this time, Haley is physically unable to respond to messages and calls.

       " \"  Hi, my name is Christa Twining, and I am fundraising for my son, Connor's, Grandmother (Nana), Donna Penhollow. Donna has been hospitalized in the critical care unit since Tuesday, January 18th, 2022. Sadly, after only a few days in the hospital, Donna's condition worsened and as of January 21st she was placed on a ventilator. Her husband of 44 years, Rex, was diagnosed with covid a few weeks prior and has been out of work ever since. Rex will continue to be out of work so he is able to be with and support his wife while she fights for her life, as time is beginning to run out.         Donna and Rex have been a part of my life for a little over 20 years. I first met them in 2002 not long after my own mother passed away. Right away Donna reassured me that I could always go to her “if I ever needed anything, big or small.” Although their son and I parted ways, they  continued to not only be amazing grandparents to Connor but they have always treated me as family. Donna and Rex are the textbook definition of the World's Greatest Grandparents. They never missed an opportunity to cheer on Connor over the years in the various sports that he participated in. I got remarried in 2016 and their love and support has never waivered. Not only did they attend our wedding but they have been nothing but supportive of the family we have built. So much so that our daughters call them Nana and Papa.          Donna's life got turned upside down 2 years ago when she was hospitalized for dizziness and confusion. It was at this time the doctors found out she was septic and eventually diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis in her lower leg. This is an aggressive form of a bacterial infection and in a matter of days it rapidly spread up her leg. This led Donna to months of being in the hospital forgoing painful debridements, and multiple skin grafts all while not being able to see family due to the pandemic. By the grace of God, her leg was saved despite the grim prognosis given by the doctors. She fought long and hard in order to return home in hopes of returning to Laketran where she was a driver for 23 years. During this time of fighting, her colleagues gave their support to Donna by donating their own PTO time, so Donna could have longer to fully recover.  Despite their best efforts she was never cleared to return to work and was forced to retire early.          By this time medical bills were piling up. Dealing with forced retirement and these medical bills, Donna's life insurance policy lapsed because it was provided through her employer. Obviously Donna and Rex never expected the current situation to happen and because of her medical history, they were unable to secure an affordable life insurance policy. Due to this, it has compounded the stress and financial burden that Rex is experiencing and greatly affecting his ability to focus 100% on being there for the love of his life.         With all that Donna and Rex have done for me, I'm hoping to be able to raise enough money to help relieve some financial burden on Rex. He is currently out of PTO time and will soon be required to take unpaid FMLA so he is able to be with Donna. I hope in some small way this will help repay all the love and support they not only have shown me but countless others over the years.          The family is continuing to pray for a miracle despite the Doctors informing us to prepare for the worst. Any amount donated will be truly appreciated, even if you can only donate prayers. Thank you for all of your support.        \",\n",
       " \"  Hi, my name is Kaitlin Ponchione, and I am fundraising for my father, George Ponchione, who was hospitalized at the beginning of December due to complications from COVID-19.          My father, George, was diagnosed with a type of cancer called chronic lymphocytic Leukemia in 2016. After months of grueling chemotherapy treatments, my dad was placed into remission. Sadly, two weeks before the pandemic began, his cancer had returned, and it was more aggressive than before.  Within a day of finding out the cancer was back, he began an oral chemotherapy treatment that lasted seven months before we found out that the chemotherapy pill had caused gout (a disease in which defective metabolism of uric acid causes arthritis) all through my dad's body. Luckily, we were able to find a better doctor who was more experience with this kind of cancer and gout. My father had a port placed in his right chest muscle to receive chemotherapy. He received six aggressive rounds of chemotherapy. After the six rounds, he was placed on a maintenance program where he received one round of medication every six weeks to help his body fight the cancer and stay in remission.  This type of cancer and treatment left my dad's immune system compromised.          Due to my dad's immune system being compromised, we took the necessary precautions to help us stay safe from COVID, but sadly that was not enough. During Thanksgiving 2021, he contracted COVID-19, and due to his non-existent immune system from his cancer, he became deathly ill. Covid caused my father to become  strong sepsis /strong (a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues). Along with the  em sepsis /em  and  em covid /em , he was diagnosed with Bacterial Pneumonia in his lungs. The Bacterial Pneumonia caused my dad's lungs to stop working effectively. The doctors had to place him on a type of breathing machine called a Bi-pap to help him breathe. The struggle continued with after a week of being in the hospital, a blood clot was discovered in his leg.          After five weeks of him continuing to fight for every breathe to live, his heart began to struggle, and my mom had to make the hard decision to place him on a ventilator. During the ventilator placement, Geroge went into cardiac arrest; luckily, the doctors could revive him.          Since hospitals have adopted new protocols because of COVID, my family has not been able to see my father in over two months. This has been emotionally hard for my dad and our family. It's awful not being able to encourage and support the one you love in person, especially when that person needs encouragement to fight for their life. The lack of time being spent in the hospital with my father has been extremely hard on his mental state. He has become quite anxious and depressed. He NEEDS LOVE AND SUPPORT to keep fighting this devastating disease.          George is a loving husband, a supportive father, a caring son, an awesome sibling, a reliable friend, and a hardworking electrician.          Since his hospitalization, my mother has been struggling to pay our mortgage, among other bills that have come up with this awful situation.  Please hear my family's cry for help. Please help us remain hopeful and keep up the good fight in these terrible and tumultuous times. Any positive wishes or contributions will make Geroge's and our family's life immeasurably easier. All support will go directly to his medical bills, travel expenses, mortgage, and other daily bills.         We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  \",\n",

Shortly after testing positive for Covid-19, Kristen was hospitalized with covid pneumonia. With every passing minute, she became weaker and weaker. As Kristen’s body was struggling to keep up with the needs of herself and the baby, it was decided that she would be placed on a ventilator. With very little signs of improvement, Kristen was transported to Indianapolis and placed on ecmo. At this same time, Dave was diagnosed with Covid pneumonia and was unable to be by Kristen’s side. On Friday, January 14, at just 29 weeks, sweet baby girl Kaci Ella Kirk was born. For 8 long days Kristen remained on ecmo but she was able to let her body rest and heal and is now completely off of all machines and has started her road to full recovery! Baby Kaci will remain in the NICU for some time but she is exceeding all expectations! Kristen is still in the hospital but is improving every single day!     As you can imagine, this is not at all what Dave and Kristen planned for financially.

I'm raising money to help my parents with medical bills, future modifications to their home, and loss of income as my dad takes time to care for my mom as she recovers.          On Friday, January 14th, my mom woke up feeling fine. She had a typical day, but around 11:00 pm, she mentioned to my dad that her neck hurt. Both of them thought that was a bit odd but just brushed it off. By 3:00 am that night, she called for help because she could not get up and slurred her words. She was rushed to the ER with what we thought was a stroke.         The ER found no sign of stroke, but she had COVID (despite being vaccinated and boosted), a couple of infections, and they suspected she had blood clots. While waiting for a bed in the hospital, she suddenly started to have trouble breathing. They initially put her on oxygen, but she started struggling to breathe again about an hour later. They put her on a ventilator and moved her to the ICU, where she has remained since Saturday, January 15th.          After running countless tests, the doctors have tentatively diagnosed and started treating her for Guillain-Barré syndrome. According to the Mayo Clinic, Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare disorder where the immune system attacks the nerves, causing paralysis. In my mom's case, she is completely paralyzed. Luckily, she can still move her eyes, and we can communicate with her through her eyes by asking her yes or no questions. As you can probably imagine, being completely aware of what is happening but not being able to move or speak is terrifying.          Doctors have started her on treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome, and she should regain her ability to move and speak eventually. However, she will likely be hospitalized for many months, and she recovers and undergoes therapies to increase her mobility and speech again.          This will be a long journey for my mom and the rest of my family, and unfortunatly it will also be an expensive one. So I'm raising money to help cover my mom's medical expenses, replace the income from any work my dad will miss, and cover any future costs related to my mom's recovery.   \",\n",
       " '  I am Sam\\'s daughter, Samantha, and I created this gofundme to help my mom with planning a final farewell to my Dad, Sam. My Dad was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 12/6/21, and was hospitalized on 12/10/21. After a week of being on oxygen, and failing to improve, he was put on a ventilator. My Dad was on a ventilator for three weeks, before ultimately passing due to deterioration throughout his whole body.     \\xa0     My Dad was a proud husband, a proud father, Papou, brother, uncle, and friend. He was a true comedian, and even in his last weeks he made sure to hold on to positivity. The last message I have in my phone between him and I was me asking how he was feeling that day (while he was in the hospital, on oxygen). His response, \"Eh, I\\'ve been better. Lol.\" Before being intubated, he asked me to make sure his friends on Facebook knew he was going to be \"AFK\" for a while. On the first attempt at extubation, when asked if there was anything he needed, he responded, \"a Guinness.\"     \\xa0     He was a sailor, a photographer, and a Veteran who served his country with pride.     \\xa0     We want to send my Dad off into his final journey with as much love as he gave to this world. I am asking for help to offset any costs my Mother will incur not only for his final farewell, but for medical bills as well.     \\xa0     I appreciate any donation, big or small, or just a prayer that my Dad has fair winds and following seas on his final journey.  His Final Farewell will be a celebration of his life on May 14th at the Pine Beach Yacht Club, a very special place to him and my family.\\xa0     \\xa0     \\xa0     No more a watch to stand, Old Sailor     For you are drifting on an ebbing tide     Eight Bells has rung, Dog Watch is done     A new berth waits you on the other side.     \\xa0     Your ship is anchored in God\\'s Harbor     And though his sailors are of equal rank     There\\'ll be shipmates on the deck to greet you     And Pipe, as you ascend the plank.     \\xa0     Her boilers with full head of steam     Cargo stowed, and galley stored     Just waiting to get underway,     When the last hand comes aboard     \\xa0     Look sharp!

       " \"  Hi, I am Dale Ommodt's daughter in law. A week before Christmas, Dale became ill with Covid. His breathing declined quickly and has been hospitalized since December 23rd. It was very touch and go for several days, but he has remained steady since New Year's Eve. Dale continues to be on an advanced oxygen machine (Hydro Flow) administering 60 liters of oxygen. He is also being monitored for blood clots in his lungs. They do have him on a blood thinner. We are not sure how long he will remain in the hospital or if he will have to go to a rehab after he is discharged. We do know that he is going to need a lot of support, financially, physically and emotionally.          Dale is a single, self-employed man. He is the owner of Crop and Livestock Nutrition in Atwater. He owns a home between Spicer and Willmar. Dale is also a member of the Spicer American legion and is the Gambling Manager there.         My husband, Don, is trying to help keep Dale's business afloat, but it is difficult as Don also works full-time with the National Guard. Our family is doing our best to take care of Dale, his business, bills and home. His health insurance deductible for 2021 and 2022 will be paid and it should cover his medical bills. Our goal is to stay current on his mortgage and other bills in effort to not have to sell Dale's personal belongings or his business equipment. We will begin selling some belongings in order to keep him from losing his home or business.         If you know Dale, you know what kind of man he is. He is a positive, loving and giving person. He is a hard worker and loves his family and friends fiercely. He is the pillar of our family and we desperately want to help him in his time of need. Please help us lift Dale up financially so that he may focus on his recovery. If you cannot donate, please consider praying for him.

       " '   Many of you may have heard about the untimely death of our great friend Darin Kotlowski.  Darin became sick with Covid 19 before Thanksgiving.  Unfortunately the virus progressed so quickly that Darin had to be hospitalized on Thanksgiving day.  Darin was in the hospital from that point on and fought so hard for Amy and Matty.  There were so many ups and downs, his body couldn’t fight any longer and he lost the battle against Covid on December 20th.              Darin and Amy were high school sweethearts, and you hardly saw one without the other.  Darin was a devoted and loving Father to their 14 year old son Matt. They spent most of their days side by side.            Darin was also like a brother to us and such a presence to so many people.  He was quick with a joke and would light up any room by his presence.  He would help anyone that was in need.              The holidays can be stressful enough, however losing your spouse and father before Christmas is unimaginable.  Please consider relieving some of the financial burden this has placed on the family by  donating to help Amy and Matty with funeral expenses and medical bills during this difficult time.   ',\n",

       " '  In less than 2 weeks I will be running my first ever half marathon. I am really looking forward to it, and am thankful for the opportunity to use my upcoming race as a means to provide support for my friends Lincoln and Darlene Johnson. I first meet these friends and incredible couple at Greenville College. Lincoln was a football player and fellow GC athlete. Darlene was a fellow education major which allowed us to share a handful of classes together. I remember the first time I met Darlene in one of our classes, I could immediately sense her genuine joy and kind heart. Interacting with Darlene was always so encouraging, which makes seeing her and her family go through this difficult time so heartbreaking.         Lincoln (26) and Darlene (27) have been married for four and a half years and are the parents of two-year-old, Josie, and six-week-old, Hazel. Lincoln is in his third year of medical school and Darlene is always busy being a wonderful mom. In September, their beautiful family of 3 grew to 4 as little Hazel came into the world, but in a way they did not expect. The Johnsons contracted COVID-19 four weeks before Hazel’s due date and while it started with mild symptoms, Darlene quickly progressed to a more severe case. She was hospitalized and delivered Hazel via c-section 3 weeks before her due date, in order to best prevent her body from shutting down further. After a few weeks of being treated in the hospital, it was clear that Darlene was not healing in the way that we would hope. On October 1st, she was intubated and put on a ventilator to help her breathe, on which she remains. Fast forward to Tuesday, October 26th, her case continued to become more severe, to the point that they called in all family members to say their goodbyes. Wednesday morning she was still there, only to make it through yet another scary day of unstable vitals. Today, she is still here with us, only by the grace of God and the many prayers He is answering. On November 19th, after a couple months in the hospital, she was transferred safely to a hospital at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and is currently in the care of an excellent medical team. At this time, we are praying and hoping for continual healing for Darlene and that she will qualify for a lung transplant.         More than donations, the family is asking for continued prayers for Darlene. It is amazing to see the miracles God has already done, and we are praying for more! I have chosen to dedicate my half marathon run in order to raise financial support for the Johnson family. I know that your generosity will be a blessing to them and will go to help cover their medical bills, rehabilitation, child care, and other living costs that are on the long road ahead of them. Please join me in praying for and supporting this incredible, God-fearing, family in this time of need.  ',\n",
       " \"  I'm not one to ask for help but this year has been incredibly rough for me. I went from living and thriving to having everything taken from me in the blink of an eye.     My name is Latisha Katrina, I am 33 years old and in January of 2021 I was hospitalized after battling an infection in my lungs all winter. Upon arrival I was rushed into emergency surgery where they found more infection in my colon and intestines also a large perforation of my bowels, which was the primary culprit. The procedure lasted over 8 hours and afterwards they were unable to wake me up, I was in a coma 6 weeks on a ventilator before I opened my eyes. While in a coma I had a severe stroke. My left side badly effected. After being in the hospital for months during the peaks of covid where no visitors where even allowed was mentally very hard for me too, I now suffer from depression, anxiety and PTSD. All things I hope to continue getting help with. From living a normal life to being unable to walk. Not to mention 3 more surgeries during this time, somehow, someway I am still here.

       " '  Our beloved pediatrician, Dr. Cecilio Eck, was recently hospitalized after contracting the Covid-19 virus in October 2021. After complications developed, he was admitted to intensive care and placed on a ventilator. Thankfully, he was taken off the ventilator successfully after five days and declared covid free and ready to be discharged after a total of two weeks in the hospital. However, further complications arose on the day that he was to be discharged and, after several tests and diagnostic procedures, it was discovered that he was suffering from significant internal bleeding requiring emergency surgical intervention.  Dr. Eck then underwent numerous blood transfusions, two significant surgeries and a second intubation for a period of six days. By the grace of God, the surgeries were successful and he again emerged from the intubation and was discharged from the hospital after a total of thirty days.     After all this, Dr. Eck faces a very long road to recovery but we remain prayerful and confident that with the excellent after care support services he is receiving, as well as dedication of his medical team, he will recover and continue his life’s ministry of healing and caring for the sick in Belize.     It follows that the consequence of his intensive medical care, need for continued physical therapy, monitoring, and home care is a significant and mounting medical bill. Dr. Eck’s after care support services, medical treatments, and medications are imperatives for his recovery for the next three to six months. Our family is humbled by the overwhelming support of the community at home and abroad and we have had several requests, especially from those friends and family living outside of Belize, to assist with fundraising efforts. As such, we have set a target of US$100,000.00 on this platform in an attempt to cover a portion of his bills.     We are sincerely grateful and thankful for family, friends, the religious community, his dedicated team of doctors, nurses, medical officers and the general public who have offered prayers, well wishes and support for him and our family. The Eck and Escalante family would like to express our sincere gratitude in advance for your kind contributions. May God continue to bless each of you and protect you and your family always.

       " '   My name is Julia and I am starting this fundraiser for my dad Julio Guevara. My dad has always been a hardworking man who has always provided for his family. Aside from that he is such an amazing dad who along with my mother has always strived for us to become the best by showing us values and principals. On May 9th, 2021, my dad became very ill and had to be taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with COVID-19. When we took him to the hospital, he was extremely hypoxic (shortness of breath, wheezing, confusion, blue lips, and oxygen saturation of 70%). He was immediately put on oxygen and given Remdesivir. At first, he reacted fine to the oxygen and Remdesivir, but 4 days later his condition became worse, and he needed to be put on a ventilator. Based on the evaluation from the doctors we were told that more than likely he was not going to make it and he would eventually pass away while on a ventilator. Due to the hospital policy changes due to COVID-19 we were only allowed to talk to him on the phone and facetime him. The hospital was kind enough to let us talk to my dad before he was put on a ventilator, and we were able to give him some words of encouragement before he was sedated. It was one of the worst experiences we have gone through as a family, but we managed to get through it and give him some words of encouragement and also to let him know how much he meant to us.            On May 13th, 2021, my dad was put on a ventilator. Despite the doctor’s evaluations my dad continued to improve and 14 days later he was able to come off the ventilator and the doctors decided to place a tracheostomy (an opening surgically created through the neck into the trachea (windpipe) to allow direct access to the breathing tube). My dad continued to improve overall over the next couple of weeks. Due to him being bed bound, his muscles started to waste which led to him becomes weak and unable to stand on his own. My dad basically had to learn how to walk, feed, and dress himself again. My dad was finally able to come home on August 31st, 2021. Once at home my dad did continue to improve but taking care of him became difficult due to his needs, but as a family we managed to care for him.            Shortly after my dad ended up in the hospital again and was diagnosed with Post-COVID-19 Cholangiopathy (Liver chemistry abnormalities, liver scarring,) which affected my dad more due to his continuous recovery from COVID-19. Since October of 2021 my dad has been in and out of the hospital because his condition continued to worsen. My dad’s liver function testing (blood tests used to help diagnose and monitor liver disease or damage) has been abnormal continuously and because of this his liver has continued to scar. He has had to have multiple Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and have stents put in place to help with his liver issues. In November of 2021 we were told that he was going to need a liver transplant due to the continuous scarring and abnormal lab values that doctors were not able to manage with other medical remedies. His care was transferred over to Georgetown Transplant center. My dad is now in need of a liver transplant and unfortunately because of his insurance which is still pending he is unable to do the transplant work-up as well as be put on a list.            We have been working to get my dad insurance since he was hospitalized back in May of 2021. My dad’s insurance terminated in April of 2021 due to him becoming part time at his job. Unexpectedly all this happened, and we have been trying to get Medicaid for him. The Medicaid process has been tough to deal with because they require a massive amount of information and even if the smallest amount of information is missing, they deny the application. It’s been about 9 months now and his Medicaid is still pending. As you can imagine we are now responsible to pay for all medical bills from May until now which is almost over $500,000. Due to this Medicaid application still pending my dad is unable to start the process for his liver work-up testing and is not able to be put on a transplant list until this is resolved. My dad is currently at Georgetown Transplant center and has been there since January 6th, 2022. The doctors and staff are doing what is within their hands to keep my dad healthy enough and strong enough to keep him going until he is able to get on a transplant list. This insurance process is what has everything at a standing point.            My mother has been taking extra shift to help pay for his medical bills, at least the small ones and my brother and I have tried to pick up shifts to help in anyway we can, but unfortunate it’s been difficult to keep up with all the bills pilling up. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my dad’s story. We thank you in advance for any help that can be given.                            img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62969099_1643501227421595_r.\"   /             img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62969099_164350301038327_r.\"   /             img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62969099_1643502989462181_r.\"   /      ',\n",

       " \"  I enlisted in the United States Army when I was 21 years old. I served my country proudly for 8 years before spending an additional 3 years in the National Guard. During my time of service, I was stationed in Iraq for 8 months during the Iraqi War. It was due to the love and pride my parents raised me to have for this country that I enlisted and was proud to serve. I was born in Ormoc City, Leyte in the Phillipines. My parents worked very hard and saved every penny to bring me here to the United States when I was 9 years old. We came legally and all earned our citizenships. My parents were so happy to raise me here and they both worked full time minimum wage jobs until their retirement. Because my parents only lived here for 16 years, the amount of social security they received was very low. The two of them lived on $1400 a month plus what I contributed to help. It was not enough. They made the unfortunate decision to move back to the Philippines. After my service, I completed a program and became a certified mechanic. Because roundtrip tickets cost at least $1200, I was only able to visit them once since they moved. Then COVID happened.     \\xa0     During Covid, my father contracted the virus, died alone in a hospital bed isolated and was buried in a plastic bag by people wearing hazmat suits because of the lack of understanding of the virus in the Philippines in January 2021. All I could do was watch this happen over a video call. My mother was not allowed to be with him in the hospital or when he was buried because she was in quarantine and couldn't even watch the burial. I wanted to bring my mother back to the United States but travel was not allowed. I tried to make arrangements many times throughout the past year but the borders were usually closed and when they are open, the quarantine requirements on both ends would have made the journey take 6 weeks for her at 72 years old.     \\xa0     About a month ago, I received word from an elderly aunt in the Phillippines that my mother had been hospitalized and diagnosed with terminal cancer. We take for granted the healthcare system we have in the United States. In the Philippines, a person is required to pay a fee upon entering the hospital. Then there are all the daily fees for the care and procedures they receive similar to the charges we have in the United States. The biggest difference is that medications are kept at private pharmacies around the island and it is the responsibility of the family to go to the pharmacies, buy the medication needed and bring it back to the hospital to be used. Hospitals don't store medication and if the family cannot afford the medication and bring it to the hospital then the patient does not receive the medication. While it is a 3rd world country, those charges are not adjusted for the cost of living there. My mother's social security for an entire month is equivalent to 35,000 Philippino pesos and her hospital bill after 3 weeks exceeded 300,000 Philippino pesos. She was sent home, but ended up contracting tuberculosis and was readmitted at which time they found out she is also suffering liver failure from cancer. They transferred her yesterday from the equivalent of a basic level hospital to a hospital more equipped to handle patients that require care similar to an Intensive Care Unit. Medical care in the Phillippines where my mother lives, there will be no cancer treatment or painstaking measures taken to save her life. But in order to continue to receive even basic medication to manage her pain, she or her family is required to pay the hospital bill ongoing. Here in the United States, we are able and fortunate to be able to make payment plan arrangements and if our loved ones cannot pay, their estate assumes the debt. My mother does not own a home or have an estate. And in the Phillippines, if the family is unable to pay, the hospital stops treatment. If there is a debt owed at the time of her death, the hospital holds the death certificate until the debt paid.     \\xa0     I have a small two-bedroom home and I am trying to pay the hospital directly, everything I can afford. But I do not have enough money to cover the surmounting hospital bills. In the end, I am truly asking for the bills to be paid so that my mother can be buried respectfully. If she weren't too sick to travel, I would fly there, bring her here and take care of her myself, but the borders are closed and I know I won't be able to see her before she passes away. I am not asking for anything for myself, and if I am able to meet my goal, the money will go directly to the OSPA Farmers Medical Center in Ormoc City, Leyte. There isn't anyone that served with me, that wouldn't vouch for my character and the quality of person I am. And now I am fighting to not leave my mother behind. Thank you.     \\xa0     If go fund me allows it, I am happy to post her medical bills as verification of this story. As of today, over 400,000 Philippino Pesos (7,804.06 USD) are owed. $1 USD is valued at 51.26 pesos. There are not words to express the shame I feel to have to ask or the gratitude that I feel toward anyone willing to help.  \",\n",

       " '  Our hearts are broken for Michelle and her 4 beautiful sweet girls as they lost Scott after a 9-week battle in the hospital. The original purpose of this Gofundme was to assist them with bills and ongoing expenses coming up, but now we have also added the expense of moving forward for this family without their key provider.\\xa0 Michelle and the girls have a hard road ahead and will need as much support as we can give them. Please share and help in any way possible.  We\\'ve created this GoFundMe to help with expenses that we know will be coming up for Scott &amp; Michelle\\'s family. Recently, Scott contracted Covid-19, and ended up being hospitalized, and now vented, fighting for his life. Michelle &amp; Scott have a beautiful family and farm, and since Scott has been sick, there has been no income for their family, and medical bills will continue to only rise. Regardless of the outcome, their family will be struggling financially for the foreseeable future, and with all of the things going on right now, this is one area that we can all help with to lessen the stress during this horrible situation. We are all not just their friends, but family. Please consider donating anything at all to help them get through this rough patch. We will post updates below that Michelle posts so that you can read their story and keep up with them. Please consider checking back on here to continue to contribute if you can. \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59872697_1631293536111943_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/10/21 - 11:40pm  /strong For a week, I was adamant about not having one of these set up. We\\'d figure it out. I\\'m currently in a spot I don\\'t think I can feasibly figure out now.  Scott lost his job last November due to Covid. He ended up taking a temporary job this year just to have some income. It was significantly lower than he made before but we did second jobs (both) to make it work. BC his job is temp, he currently has zero medical insurance, life insurance, and no FMLA paid leave benefits.  I am currently realizing just how deep into the darkness I am with bills, both medical and regular, and possibly a funeral. I cant do this, I\\'m ashamed to admit. Scott was the bread winner around here.  I hate asking for help, but I kept looking at my girls pretending it was going to be okay, knowing its not. Even if a miracle happens, it\\'ll be months before he comes home. I am trying hard to do it on my own bc I\\'ve never had to ask for help and it embarrasses me, but I\\'ve got 4 sets of little eyes looking to me to be there for them in the ways Scott and I both were there, shelter them, and protect them. All whilst trying to be there for him as well. Being thrown to the fires this hard, unexpectedly, has made me realistic about my situation. And its a pickle for sure. strong   Update from Michelle: 9/10/21 - 12:49pm /strong  My heart is so heavy and mad right now I can\\'t even process what I\\'m feeling. Today, I\\'ve learned that my love now has a very rare condition, so rare that his cardiologist hasn\\'t ever personally seen it. Its not good. Pneumomediastinum. Write that down and curse every syllable, please? Its effecting his once perfect heart (that he was given a perfect score on just the other day.) The vent is currently working at max for him. \\xa0 All the care teams are currently discussing a course of action, if any, can be taken. But when you\\'re given a very very poor prognosis, at this rate we are needing a miracle for Scott. I\\'m barely holding composure to write this as I\\'m so angry. So hurt. So scared. I\\'m so worried I have to tell my girls their loving Dad is probably going to die. I don\\'t even know how to do that. I don\\'t want to do this life alone, without him. Not at all. He kept telling me he won\\'t survive the vent, and I keep hoping he\\'s wrong as usual. \\xa0 I want to hold his hand and kiss his face, and just snuggle up to him. And I can\\'t do any of that. Maybe not even be able to ever again. I am so broken right now. And hanging onto the hopes that his soul and will to be with us again is stronger than the the things trying to take him away from us. \\xa0 I am going to rest for right now. Terrified of what that future phone call holds for me, and us. Please refrain from actually calling me right now. I cant turn my ringer down bc I need to answer the when the hospital calls. But I am so, so worn out and beaten down, I need to do this so I can be strong for the girls when they get home from school. \\xa0 Continue to message and text,- that\\'s okay- I\\'ve got those silenced, but please....let me rest a bit. And pray harder than you ever have before!!!!!      img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59872697_1631293885637145_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     \\xa0     \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/9/21 - 12:42pm /strong      9:33 a.m, as I was gathering up things to take up to his room to make it cozy and be of a constant reminder of home, we stopped treading water and dove fully into the deep end.     \\xa0     The hospital called to inform me they would be fully intubating him immediately after I was able to \"talk\" to him. I said my \"I love you\" and got a very emotional, Darth Vader styled \"I love you\" back. Followed by lots of crying and him muttering that he\\'s scared. (Background info for those that don\\'t know. Scott was a respiratory therapist and an Army Medic, served in Desert Storm. He is VERY aware of everything happening right now, the severity of condition he\\'s in, risks with intubation, and mortality rates for his conditions alone, not even including covid). He\\'s terrified. Broke me into so many pieces that I\\'m still trying to pick them up.     \\xa0     His machine started honking ferociously as his vitals were all over the place. And as I was telling him to relax and that I would see him when he wakes up, they had to hang up bc he was getting too upset.     As a roller coaster enthusiast, I don\\'t like this one very much. I\\'ve not even been able to process hurdles and emotionally deal with them before being thrown to the fires with the next.     \\xa0     I hope this isn\\'t the trend from here on out.     I hope his ability to fully rest will heal him with no more setbacks.     I hope he\\'s awake in a week.     I mostly hope his fears do not come to fruition.     I need this man to come back home to us.     \\xa0     But we never have done shit the easy way, have we?     Today we took two steps back, and then just decided to gear up in a wing suit and jump off the cliff. Just out here floating around on the wings of hope.     That\\'s where we are.     Please keep our babies in your hearts.     \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/9/21 - 3:46am /strong      One step forward; two steps back. It is just the way we roll around here. Had an emergency visit to the hospital this evening.     \\xa0     Scott\\'s lung x-rays were showing a &lt;2cm pneumothorax (collapsed lung) on one side, and possibly the start of another on the other side. They were doing emergency surgery and he was being taken to ICU for chest tube surgery.     \\xa0     I finally got to see him for the first time and visit with him for a little bit while he was waiting to go into surgery. A VERY emotional visit, as we both knew very well that it could be the last time we saw and spoke to one another. I got the girls on a video call with him so he could see them and they could tell him whatever they wanted. He was VERY emotional during this, so much that I had to hang up so he could calm down and we could get his heart rate and o2 to level back out. I\\'m pretty sure I experienced every single emotion known to man, all in a very short time span. Im also a Cancer, so I\\'m EXTRA on the crybaby gene.     \\xa0     We were also able to scramble together (very last minute) a last will and testament and a POA, after days of trying hard to get it done. A feat not proving to be easy, given the nature of his illness and the no visitors rule, combined with needing it over a holiday weekend, combined with no money to pay for one. But we did it, thanks for the life saving attorney husband of a dear friend of mine. He helped guide me through the constantly evolving situation up there, concerning the whole thing.     \\xa0     This urgent process is not fun. I give it zero out of 5 stars.     During surgery, he had a bit of a tough time, so sedation was increased to make him feel more comfortable.     He expressed his wishes NOT to be intubated unless he absolutely needed it. Having been a respiratory therapist and an Army medic, he fully understands the severity of intubation and how it can negatively effect the lungs with tons of pneumonia. He\\'s already got that badly, he did not want to potentially add more to it. So again, this man has managed to escaped intubation. But still, treading very thin waters.     \\xa0     The good news is he is out of surgery, and doing well currently. The bad news is that he is maxed out on bipap still. Any decreases in vitals will require intubation at this point.     \\xa0     He is terrified of this situation. I think, in part because he isn\\'t confident he would survive it, and in part because has been on the other side of intubation. He knows the whole process, complications, and recovery processes. I hope it\\'s more of the latter.     \\xa0     I\\'m still hoping for miraculous healing without vent work, and no post complications. Please continue to hope, pray, and love to your hearts content. I fear that we are not even close to being out of the water, and have just merely waded in at this point instead.     \\xa0     For those wondering how I am doing (with having covid and dealing with all of this), I am physically fine, mentally exhausted, and emotionally drained. Having said that, it\\'s 3:42 am and I have to get up at 5:30 to start the day. Goodnight and I will keep you all posted......     \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/7/21 - 9:48am /strong      Most of you reading this are not aware of this, and I apologize. But I wanted to tell everyone why I\\'ve not been responding back to messages/texts about random things. Only 2 handfuls of you know that Scott caught Covid, and we were all quarantined. I had to rush him to the hospital when he was at the tail end of his quarantine bc he started to exhibit severe respiratory distress signs. He was immediately admitted. His o2 sats were only at 50% when he was admitted. He ended up tanking while I was out getting his meds/vitamins/ electrolytes for him, and my covid test. I came back home and honestly thought he had passed bc of the way he looked. Major cyanosis and the rest of his skin was white or ashen. He\\'s been in since his birthday, Monday, August 30th     \\xa0     At this point, I don\\'t know what the outcome will be. As many of you know, its very touch and go with this illness. He\\'s had good days and some really bad, scary ones. He\\'s been on 100% oxygen for most of his stay. His pneumonia is worsening and x-rays yesterday are showing more infiltrates on his lungs.     \\xa0     By whatever grace though, he\\'s NOT been intubated ...yet. And I\\'m double crossing all my fingers and toes he wont be. But he is straddling a really fine line to being so. He\\'s currently on the last step before intubation. Some days improving, while others taking steps back. I keep being told he\\'s looking at weeks in there unless a miracle happens and his infection miraculously heals and clears. But even IF that happens, his road to recovery will be long due to scar tissue on the lungs he will more than likely have coming out.     \\xa0     I\\'m trying very hard to be optimistic but realistic. But slowly getting discouraged.     This week, I\\'m working on preparing a living will for us (bc we didn\\'t have one prior) and I\\'m not going to lie- I\\'m scared shitless. I\\'m stressed for other reasons, and I just want everything to go back to normal. Our normal, which is weird as hell, as you all know.     \\xa0     I don\\'t know what any day brings, but I do know I could really use your prayers, well wishes, good graces, and love. I just want to hear my friends, and my people right now. ❤ I wasn\\'t going to post publicly bc I hate making people fret and worry (and I\\'m relatively a private person in this regard), but so many folks keep trying to reach out to me for random stuff, and because I\\'ve not felt well enough for small talk, I needed to address it.     \\xa0     I ended up catching covid from him and have been at home, alone with the kids, with them to watch out for me. All the while, trying to take care of them AND stay away from them. Not the easiest task by any means.     Please keep him and us in your thoughts. I\\'m banking on your positivity to carry me through bc I know I\\'m going to drown in my own thoughts some days.     Love to you all. And sorry if I don\\'t respond back to you. I don\\'t mean any rudeness.     \\xa0     \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59872697_163129416417450_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0  ',\n",
       " '  We are all devastated by Dean\\'s loss and were no prepared for a high cost of a funeral service.\\xa0 I want to give Dean, my dearest beloved husband, the memorial he deserves, to honor his memory and say our last goodbyes.\\xa0 I am currently asking for donations to help cover the cost of Dean\\'s funeral. We need to raise $28,000 by the end of the day of October 25th in order to be able to afford the funeral service. Please consider donating if you are able to do so, as any amount will truly help. We are so very grateful for every donation during this difficult time.     \\xa0     Hi, my name is Victoria, and I\\'m fundraising for the love of my life, my dear husband Dean Shifflett.     Two years ago, we stood united as a family, asking for your support as Dean started his battle with cancer. After over two years of extensive treatments and enduring its effects on his body both physically and mentally, Dean was finally in remission.     We got engaged, moved back to Virginia to be closer to friends and family, and Dean started a new job.     He was finally able to start a \"normal\" life, and once again, he finds himself fighting for his life.     Today we ask for support in fighting Dean\\'s new enemy, COVID.     As many of you have seen on Facebook or heard, on August 20, 2021, Dean was diagnosed with COVID-19, despite being vaccinated, due to his compromised immune system. He was sent home to quarantine and rest. However, each day he was getting worse, and on August 30, 2021, he was hospitalized with COVID double pneumonia and a clot in his lung.     In the first week of him being in the hospital, doctors changed his medication regimen several times due to a rapid progression in his pneumonia.     Week two, Dean was put on a high-flow oxygen machine, and doctors struggled to keep his oxygen at the optimum level. Unfortunately, several times his oxygen levels dropped to the critical level causing him to faint.     On September 13, 2021, Dean was transferred to the MCU unit needing more intensive medical care. The high-flow oxygen machine was working on 100%, and he was heavily sedated.     His body was worn out, and his lungs were tired from labored breathing. Despite doctors\\' efforts to keep him off the ventilator, sadly, yesterday, September 16, 2021, Dean was transferred to ICU and intubated.     Earlier this week, I received the notice that Dean is out of his sick days and will need to go on personal leave (which is unpaid) or file for short-term disability (60% of his pay) what we are working on now.     Medical bills are adding up as we are still paying the bills incurred from cancer treatment.     \\xa0     Please consider a donation to help with increasing medical expenses.     We are asking for prayers of healing and recovery for Dean.  ',\n",

       " '   **UPDATE: upon further inquiring about the medical bill, we have decided to raise the goal at at least a quarter of the total as of October 22, 2021**         Hey there! My name is Shelby Plourde, one of three daughters to Kevin.  Due to unfortunate circumstances, my dad caught COVID and has been hospitalized for the last 3 weeks and counting, while being on the ventilator for the last 2, and counting.             For a little more of a background, we moved to Virginia after growing up and living most of our lives in Maine. My dad had received a devastating call that his mother was not doing well which ultimately brought our family back up to visit Maine, for longer than expected. Upon going through this journey with his mother for almost a month, she had passed away and a week later we found out that my dad had contracted COVID.             He was hoping that it was just something smaller such as the Flu, or every day cold until it got to the point where he was struggling to breathe. Since September 30th of this year, my dad has been in the hospital fighting for his life  beginning with a simple bipap and high flow oxygen mask to a week later being put under medically induced coma  so that he can be ventilated to attempt to get more oxygen through out his body and battle COVID and the ecoli from Pneumonia as well.             I have created this Go Fund Me for my mom, Kim, to try and help her through this time. I can only imagine the emotional strain she is going through, so as you can imagine medical bills on top of every day bills become that much harder for a single person. Anything helps through this unknown amount of time while the doctors do as much as they can to help while we continue to grow our army of prayers. God is doing is work and will continue to do so!             Thanks so much in advance!   ',\n",

He was very ill and working to get symptoms under control. He took a trip to the ER where they sent him home on oxygen. He needed constant round-the-clock care.  My grandma, mom, and uncle were able to keep him going through this time. On January 3rd, he went to the ER again, this time by ambulance. He was diagnosed with Pneumonia and Sepsis. He spent 4 days in the ER on a gurney waiting for a hospital bed to open up. He was finally moved to the ICU where they were better able to assess his needs. He has since been moved to the acute care unit. Today marks his 12th day in the hospital. Since being hospitalized he has experienced congestive heart failure, continued difficulties in regulating his blood sugar levels and blood pressure.

Then they\\'ll flip hip over, do a chest x-ray, do another blood gas and then reassess. Still worried about the blood sugar and blood clots and trying to keep those in check.  07.16.20 AM Daily update on Mike: The ventilator oxygen settings are down to 60%, which is turned down 15% since yesterday. This is GOOD! They are experimenting with different settings and modes to try and make sure the airflow is ideal for him. He is not in the prone position right now, but they may prone him tonight due to some issues with the CO2 content in his blood. His blood sugar was down this morning but back up at lunch so they are trying a new type of insulin. The blood clot in his leg is getting worse, so they are going to try some additional treatments to help break it up. Channel 6 news reached out again today and asked me to do a follow up interview, so that should air tonight either on the evening broadcast or on the 11pm broadcast. If telling our story and educating people on the importance of donating antibody plasma can help families like ours, we want to do it. Thank you guys for the continued love and support. Our family is hanging in the best we can and trying to stay positive.  07.15.20 Good news and bad news in today\\'s update on Mike. The good news is that he got the convalescent plasma The bad news is that his blood oxygen levels dropped pretty significantly during the night, and they had to up the ventilator settings from 65% oxygen to 75% oxygen. This nurse was the sweetest one I\\'ve spoken to by far. She went into his room and put the phone on speaker phone so that I could talk to him and tell him how much the girls and I love him and how hard everyone is praying. He\\'s sedated of course, but just talking to him felt good.  07.13.20 Update: His blood oxygen level got worse over night, so they have him in the prone position again on his stomach for 16 hours. They are fighting with his blood sugar and are having to give him lots of meds and insulin to try and keep it down. They found a blood clot in his leg, which is common with people hospitalized with COVID, so they have him on a heparin drip. We are on the waiting list for convalescent plasma treatment. Please pray that he is able to get this soon.  07.12.20 This poor little guy misses his dad Jude keeps yowling at the front door and doesn\\'t want to eat his food. He and Mike are best buddies.  07.11.20  For those of you that don\\'t know, my husband, Mike is in the ICU with COVID on a ventilator. He\\'s sedated and seems to be taking to the ventilator okay. We can use lots of prayers .  07.08.20 Initially hospitalized after rapid test.

       " '   strong Update: We just found out their insurance runs out at the end of November.\\xa0   /strong Heather and Frank have had a brutal last couple of years. \\xa0Frank is now battling colon cancer and Heather recently lost her job because of the time she\\'s had to take off to support Frank, making both of them unemployed. On top of that, they will both lose their health insurance by the end of November 2021. They have reached a breaking point physically, emotionally, and financially. \\xa0They have no savings left and the bills are mounting. They may loss their home and everything the\\'ve worked for. Heather is struggling daily with her anxiety and depression from all the trauma. \"Just taking a shower or leaving the house is a chore,\" she says. Couple that with Frank\\'s upcoming surgery and chemo appointments and the caregiving she\\'ll need to provide Frank and it\\'s clear that Heather needs some help.   Thank you for whatever you can give. Share the link if you\\'re inspired to do so on your social media and join me in sending them positive healing vibes as they are much needed at this time.   strong Who I and why I\\'m doing this:\\xa0 /strong  My name is Camille, a good friend of Heather and Frank, and am starting this go fund me page to help them get through a devastating and horrific life experience that has been going on for over a year and a half now. It continues today. They are on the cusp of running out of all their savings and are now dealing with a new medical situation that has put their lives in a precarious situation. (You may remember Heather and Frank\\'s story in last year\\'s Anchorage Daily News posted August 29th, 2020. See link below.) I am here to raise $10,000 to help them with their medical expenses and bring some much needed income into their daily living so they can keep their home and make ends meet. It\\'s been tough getting Frank and Heather to say yes to this because they are not takers; they\\'re givers. However I told them that it was time for them to receive.     \\xa0      strong A Summary of their Trauma /strong      Last June, after spending five days in the hospital where Heather had her neck fused at seven levels front and back, she returned home. The next day Frank didn\\'t feel well and Heather took his temperature. It read 106.4. He drove himself to the ER while Heather, shocked and scared, stayed behind unable to move because of her surgery. Frank\\'s condition worsened and continued to deteriorate upon arrival. Oxygen tubes went in his nose and his doctor confirmed he had COVID-19 on his second day there.     \\xa0     Meanwhile Heather was now in quarantine for ten days and unable to have anyone come into the home. Frank was suppose to be her caregiver and assist with rehabilitation but that plan was no longer in play. Heather struggled to care for herself alone and went five days without a shower because she couldn’t properly cover her incisions. Though she could reach Frank by phone, he labored to talk. Frank\\'s condition was so bad that he was put into a negative pressure room where he was on high flow oxygen for two weeks. He wondered if he’d survive.\\xa0“For about a week, it got real bad,” he says.     \\xa0     Heather, home alone with her own worry, fell into a routine of calling Frank’s nurses each morning at 11 a.m., hoping for good news. However, for several days the news was bleak. After nearly three weeks of treatment, Frank was able to return home but had to now quarantine himself and couldn\\'t even hug his wife.     \\xa0     A day after returning home, after 24 years of work, Frank lost his job.     \\xa0     In the weeks that followed, Frank lost his brother just a year after losing their father. Heather lost her mom and between the two of them over ten friends and family members died. The stress of this trauma was clear to me at Heather\\'s mother\\'s funeral. I became very concerned about their mental and emotional health as this was clearly way more than two people should be given to deal with. Those close to Heather know that she has also been a caregiver to her step-father and her mother for over ten years. In 2019 alone, Heather took them to the hospital a total of 42 times! As a caregiver myself, I know personally the debilitating effect full time caregiving does to a person. The wear and tear is real yet can go unnoticed by those closest to them.     \\xa0     Fast forward to the weekend of September 24th, 2021. Frank had a colonoscopy that revealed he has colon cancer. Laster that day, Heather lost her job. The next day, Frank found out he had a heart attack back in August when he was hospitalized again for unknown reasons. That afternoon, Frank\\'s daughter Jenny, seven month\\'s pregnant was hospitalized after testing positive for COVID. On a ventilator for two weeks, they put her into a deep coma and delivered the baby who weighed 3.7 lbs. The baby also had to be put on a ventilator. As I write this, Frank is scheduled for a CAT scan this week. They also need to do a stress test to see if his heart can handle the two surgeries needed to remove the large mass. Then there\\'s the chemo and radiation.     \\xa0     Though it\\'s still very uncomfortable for them to allow me to do this, they have no other option. Please help as you can. I will keep you updated as things unfold. If you believe in the power of prayer, please join me in calling forth the miracle needed. Thank you so much.

My mother, Elaine, has been a front-line healthcare worker at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and continued to do COVID-19 related work for her job early on in the pandemic.   She and I recently tested positive for COVID-19. My mother was hospitalized the second week of February and has since been in a COVID ICU unit on a ventilator in a medically-induced coma fighting for her life. I am home caring for myself and two cats while worrying about her and her condition, myself, our medical bills, home expenses, etc.   Navigating house expenses without her has been a challenge. I recently received a medical bill in the mail from an ER visit for myself that my insurance didn\\'t fully cover. It was only for one night in the ER and it was over $3,000 so you can understand why I am so deeply concerned for the medical bills she will receive for being in the ICU for more than 10 days now.  My mother also went through a difficult divorce less than 2 years ago that was the result of a horrible domestic violence situation. She is still struggling to pay her legal fees so on top of her situation pre-COVID and now testing positive and being critical enough to end up in the ICU, it hasn\\'t been easy for her or myself for a very long time.\\xa0  Any money collected for this fundraiser will go directly to my medical bills, my mother\\'s medical bills, our home expenses and home bills, her existing bills from legal fees, my medications, her medications, her future medical bills, etc. Because my mother has pre-existing health conditions, I anticipate that she will have a long road to recovery if, God willing, she makes it out of the ICU. The money collected will also go to the possible rehabilitation or medical aftercare she may need. The money will also allow her and I to take time off of work to mentally and physically heal from the traumatic experience this has caused us.\\xa0  Please pray for my mother that she heals and can come home to me. My mother is my best friend. The past few days have been incredibly difficult for me.  I thought it would be too triggering to include a photo of her on the ventilator. I was able to briefly FaceTime her before the ICU doctors put her on the ventilator. Because of new COVID rules, hospital visitation is not allowed or extremely limited and because I have COVID I wouldn\\'t be allowed in anyway. I requested to FaceTime her when she was on the ventilator a few days later on my birthday because I believe she can still hear me. I wanted her to hear my voice and know I was there with her supporting her. I took a screenshot of the FaceTime, but it\\'s very difficult even for me to look at it. Here is a nice photo of us pre-COVID.  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54763364_1613775111584900_r.jpeg\" alt=\"54763364_1613775111584900_r.jpeg\"     / ',\n",

Your kind donations will go to cover his monthly expenses during his recovery and hospital bills.         At the end of June, my Dad got an infection on his leg that required hospitalization. He had three surgeries to remove infected tissue from the shin of his right leg. There was extensive tissue removed approximately 5 inches wide by 8 inches long. By the third surgery his body was in shock and his blood sugar levels and blood pressure were not controllable, so he went into the ICU until it was stabilized. His first stay in the hospital was one week. He will require skin grafts for his wound. Over July and August he had a wound vac for his leg and was going in to change his dressings every other day. He worked as much a possible during this time even though he was often nauseous and unable to sleep and eat.         In mid-August, he tested positive for COVID and had to be hospitalized. His immune system was not strong enough to fight COVID. He went on a ventilator on August 29th and was put into the COVID ICU. On Friday, September 3rd we received hopeful news that they were lowering the oxygen and sedation medication that he is receiving. His body did not react favorably and currently he is still sedated and on a ventilator. We are very hopeful for a full recovery.

She had to discontinue working, forcing a situation where they had to rely strictly on social security for their income.     \\xa0     Michael is legally blind so Heather was the only driver in the household out of necessity. When she could no longer work or drive it caused even more difficulties and challenges.

Over the summer Heather was hospitalized with covid and was on a ventilator. While going through that she had another stroke, once again, the left side was affected. But it was worse this time. Heather cannot speak or move her left side.     \\xa0     She’s finally over the covid and has been moved to a rehab facility to hopefully regain movement in her left side and speak again. Meanwhile, Michael is doing his best to keep the household going and look after Heather’s son.     \\xa0     I always believed that when people get together, the impossible becomes possible. My GoFundMe aim is to help Michael and Heather during this difficult time. So if this story touches you, please consider donating to their expenses and share this with friends and family.

Trying to get things sorted out properly, and funding everything is definitely going to be a challenge.\\xa0 Please help if you can.\\xa0 No amount is too small, and every penny adds up.\\xa0 I need to keep this short because I want to get on the road.\\xa0 Thank you all, and I'll update as I can.\\xa0 The original write up is below, should you want to read it.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0     \\xa0 \\xa0 Hello everyone, my name is Patrick, and my brother Kevin and I are trying desperately to raise money for our father Frank. He's been hospitalized with Covid since January 14th.\\xa0 He was placed on a ventilator, given a feeding tube, and induced into coma on January 21st.\\xa0 This alone could last as long as 3 weeks.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Everyone knows that once on a ventilator Covid is very tough to recover from, and the harsh reality is that many people don't survive. Our dad however, is strong and that's why we feel like he's got a fighting chance.\\xa0     \\xa0 \\xa0 During this very difficult time, we're asking for you to donate anything you can spare to help Kevin and I handle dad's current and upcoming expenses through all this. Not only does our dad have regular living expenses that we're taking on while he's in the hospital (which will likely be months), he'll also have expenses once he's out of the hospital. Expenses like short and long term assistance not provided by insurance can be overwhelming for anyone, especially someone like dad who's on a very fixed income. He's also losing the income from his job which makes things even harder.\\xa0     \\xa0 \\xa0 The preferred outcome is that dad survive his ordeal and recover fully. However, the honest truth is, should the fight be too great, and he can't overcome this infection, we'll need your help with the less pleasant expenses as well.\\xa0     \\xa0 \\xa0 Kevin and I have talked extensively about the situation, and have come to a very sad and embarrassing conclusion. That even through combining all our available resources, we just can't provide for the coming expenses whatever they may be.     \\xa0 \\xa0 We sincerely need your help, and humbly ask you to donate whatever you can spare to assist us. Anyone who knows our father knows that he's genuinely a good person and deserves every effort we put forth to help him.\\xa0     \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Thank you all for listening, Kevin and I sincerely thank you from our hearts.\\xa0\\xa0  \",\n",

       " '  A love story called Spigas.     \\xa0     This is a love story between a couple called Omar and Stephanie and how their love developed into living the American dream, they call Spigas. Omar Lopez and his wife, Aurora Estefania Ramirez (AKA Stephanie) along with their then 2-year-old daughter, Ahtziri Lopez, always had the American dream of opening a business in the United States. Omar and Stephanie met while both working for a California based bread company. They have been together over 25 years. Omar a Baker for approximately 15 years and Stephanie as a Cashier for over 5 years. Omar comes from a long family line of Bakers in Puebla, Mexico, where he inherited his talent, gift and passion for baking as a child in his family’s bakeries. After his family closed their bakeries in Mexico, he decided to come to the United States, at the early age of 16 to continue his passion for baking. Stephanie was 7 years old when her family came to the United States from Jalisco, Mexico. The addition to this love story is the birth of their daughter, Ahtziri Lopez, born in Orange, CA. She is now 12 years old. Orange County is where they decided to plant their home and business. After many thoughts of opening a bakery business, Spigas Bakery &amp; Café was born and opened in November 2011 in Orange, CA. The word Spiga means ear of corn, the part of a cereal plant which contains the seed, a flower of wheat. Omar named the business Spigas after the meaning. Omar continued to work both Spigas and at Yard House in Irvine, simultaneously, to provide for his is little family and Spigas. Over the past 10 years, Omar and Stephanie developed a strong “Spigas family” among their daily customers, local neighbors, local Fire and Police Departments, local businesses and hotels who ordered for their daily needs. In early October 2020, Omar was struck with COVID-19 and hospitalized in ICU as both his lungs were shutting down. He was intubated, placed on a ventilator as COVID-19 inflamed his airways and drowned his lungs with fluids. He was near death. Stephanie and Ahtziri, obviously were scared and devastated, the strongest person in their family, they could not visit or talk to, and no idea what the future held for Omar. Stephanie shared the love of her life and breadwinner was hospitalized. She shared all employees left as no income, no bread or pastries to sell, she survived on the savings they had both built together. Eventually, Doctors told her they were going to take a different approach to get his lungs to open back up, they did, and it worked, however, he had a long road ahead of recovery. This meant no physical work. Omar eventually left the hospital very weak, still on oxygen at home end of December 2020. During this time, Stephanie did whatever it took to continue keeping Spigas open, even many times, half days. Omar was given the go ahead to return to work, June 2021. Omar shares he was still weak, but able to bake his goodies! Then on December 7, 2021, at 4:00 a.m., tragedy struck in a way no one saw it coming. Just when Spigas was showing signs of sparkle and the beginning of a new start with Omar back home in the kitchen baking, in the middle of the night, a fire erupted in the back area of the kitchen and bakery. At this time due to the fire aftermath and for the safety of all, Spigas has had to close temporarily. Omar, Stephanie and especially their daughter Ahtziri are beyond devastated. Spigas is their only source of income for their family. The recent set back from Omar hospitalized and in recovery, with COVID-19, already made a huge dent in their financial ability to stay afloat with bills both for business and personally. They used up all their savings. Bills were piling up, lapse in insurance. They are overwhelmed with grief and heartache, plus the unknown to what the future means for Spigas and to meet their daily family needs at home. This is the season for giving. My name is Ruthi,     am a close friend to Omar and Stephanie of over 9 years. I am reaching out to ask if anyone wishes to share their story and donate or contribute to a miracle for this family and their beloved Spigas.

       " '  Please help the Cadena family with medical and travel expenses during this hard time.     \\xa0     Paul has been hospitalized for a little over 3 months after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He is currently on a ventilator helping him breath and is hospitalized at a long term care hospital 3 + hours away from his loved ones. At this time we are asking for any help toward traveling, lodging, and medical expenses. Below is a little history of what struggles he has gone through in the last 5 years medically before his long term hospitalization in September of 2021.     \\xa0     On September 20, 2016 life was forever changed for Paul, April, and the Cadena family. Paul was admitted to a local Green Bay hospital for a DVT in his leg blocking all blood flow and bilateral pulmonary embolisms (blood clots in both lungs). In the months to follow, it was discovered that the cause of this event were MULTIPLE chronic health concerns . An autoimmune disorders known as Anti Phospholipid syndrome, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Lupus were just 3 auto immune disorders Paul was diagnosed with. Paul was also diagnosed with a clotting disorder that is the opposite of hemophilia, Thrombophilia. This is a disorder that makes the affected person over produce blood clots causing problems like DVTs and Pulmonary emboli.     \\xa0     In July of 2017, Paul lost his job after his health condition changed and effected his ability to work outside of the home any longer.     \\xa0     In November of 2020, Paul and April decided it would be best to move to Paul’s hometown in the Texas panhandle from to experience the warm climate that would help his many health conditions.     \\xa0     In July of 2021, Paul suffered from a case of diverticulitis (infection in the intestine). Because of his already fragile health, he spent 3 days in the ICU followed by another week in recovery and care from home health. As the infection healed the doctor informed Paul that he would need a portion of his colon removed due to the damage the infection caused. In order to do this surgery, Paul would need to be off all of his autoimmune medications increasing his vulnerability to other illnesses.     \\xa0     On September 20th Paul tested positive for COVID-19 during some pre-op testing. One week later Paul was admitted to a local hospital with His Oxygen saturation in the 70’s. Paul’s condition continued to decline when he developed COVID pneumonia. Eventually he tested negative for Covid but the damage still continued. On October 17th Paul had to be put on a ventilator to support his breathing. the doctors also deemed it necessary to place Paul in a medically induced coma to protect his brain from any further damage and to provide his body with rest. On October 27th he was admitted to a long term specialty hospital in Lubbock Taxes where he is expected to stay for 1-3 months. Shortly after arriving in Lubbock, Paul had a feeding tube surgically placed in his stomach for long term nourishment. On November 2nd he had surgery to place a tracheotomy due to long term lung damage. Paul is showing small improvements including slowly waking from the medically induced coma. On November 10th Paul needed a blood transfusion to help his declining blood levels. Only a couple days after he battled both extreme high and low blood pressures that proved to make his battle even trickier. After several tests, a heart attack was ruled out and it was confirmed he was bleeding somewhere internally. He needed his second blood transfusion on November 14th. Doctors believe that Paul has a slow bleed in the GI track that is causing him to loose so much blood most likely from the area they originally wanted to remove before COVID took over. Doctors are working very hard to figure out all of the many medical obstacles that have hindered Pauls recovery.     \\xa0     Paul is a loving Husband to April, father to 4 beautiful children (Lita, Tony, Victoria, and Christian), and the most loving Papa to Violette. Please keep Paul and the entire Cadena family in your thoughts and prayers as they navigate through this tough time. If you can find it in yourself to help out financially any amount is very appreciated  ',\n",

SVSU, in August of 2021, created a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for students and staff. Those who are not vaccinated have to be tested bi-weekly. This week, those who feel that we have the freedom to choose what we do with our bodies received an email. Be Vaccinated, Be tested or Be Fined. We will be fined $100 every month we decide to do what we want to do with our bodies. This is 4-6 months just for this year. $600 per student.  I graduate in May of 2023, next year. For me, that is $1600 until I graduate. I also pay for my own college, food, housing. I am a responsible adult.  I would also like everyone to know I turned in a religious exemption that has not been approved or denied. I also know that GOD will take me home whenever HE pleases. I put my faith in HIM .  I also understand the importance of staying home when you are sick. If I was feeling sick or exposed, I would get tested. I also know the severity of COVID-19. In December of 2020, my dad was hospitalized with COVID-19 and was put on oxygen for weeks. My sister was on a ventilator with COVID. She is alive, and the only one to thank is GOD.  I wear a mask in public. I avoid those who have been exposed or tested positive.

       " '  Nancy Fay, who has been an INCREDIBLY selfless promoter of quality equestrian competition - especially for the local grassroots horse show series- really needs our support. Whether you’ve heard her announcing horse shows or bombarded her with emails about your kid’s points for a certain show series - if you’re into horseshows, you’ve crossed paths with Nancy Fay.     Since March of 2020 Nancy has been \\xa0 hospitalized and under intense medical care,  having even spent months on a ventilator (not COVID related) and in a coma. She spent the summer in basically a mental fog from a combination drug therapies and ‘lack of organ cooperation’, for lack of better words. She just this week finally had her trach removed which is a great step towards recovery, \\xa0but continues to need daily dialysis while her kidneys get their act together. She is working hard in physical therapy with the goal to stand and walk again.     Because of “THE ALL OF THIS”, Nancy is going to need time in a facility as a long term care resident, and to be frank, insurance is running out. I’m asking for the equestrian community to step in to help one of our own.  Nancy has been a mentor of mine for over 20 years. When I was a bright eyed pony kid volunteer at Shannondell Farm Nancy took me under her wing and taught me all about horse show management - and even let me announce to my delight! She was always trying to include and educate anyone who simply had love for the sport. This was what fueled her passion for the freedom horse show series - an organization that she \\xa0volunteered countless hours towards - just to promote quality horse shows to the people that love the sport. Seriously though- she had no skin in the game! She didn’t own/buy/sell horses, have students or family that competed - she just loved doing it. So for that and all that she has done for her friends, I’m starting this go fund me to help ease the financial burden on Fay while she continues her journey to recovery and hopefully independence again. Thank you for your support!  ',\n",

While receiving treatment gives him the best chance at waking up, it could be up to 2 months before that happens. It has been a hard fought battle for Justin, and will remain so long after he comes out of sedation. He will have a lengthy, difficult, recovery when he comes home and will be out of work for an unforeseeable amount of time. He will need support and it will leave his new wife, Darian, unable to work while caring for him as well. While we know Justin to be incredibly tenacious, and trust that he will come back stronger, we would also like to minimize the residual effects this has on his family. His wife was just approved to visit him, so there will be expenses for travel, lodging, and food, in addition to all of their regular expenses. This is heavy for a family that has been affected by the shutdowns from COVID multiple times throughout the last year. Justin is a gift in our world, he is thoughtful, giving, funny, and makes the lives of those who know him better.

After celebrating my son's birthday and Easter in April, only 2 weeks later she was hospitalized and diagnosed with Covid.  My Mom was placed on a ventilator for 28 days until finally being able to have a tracheotomy put in mid May.

June 23rd she finally regained consciousness after being sedated since April and after months of continued hospitalization and rehab, she was released to me September 24th. She still has severe lung damage, is on oxygen probably for the remainder of her life, and  has physical therapy in an effort to regain her ability to walk.

Laura with a stroke and brain bleed and Paula,  their Mom on a ventilator with COVID. Both women have prayers constantly going their way to heal and pull through these times. Although the future is unanswered for them at this time, unfortunately the costs of funeral expenses for Faith and their day to day living expense have not stopped. They have animals, rent, utilities and will need extensive medical treatments going forward.     Beyond her own everyday life of raising 6 children and trying to comfort them and herself as they lost their Aunt as well as their other Aunt and Grandmother hospitalized, Megan has graciously taken care of the animals and tried to maintain the home as best as possible right now. This is a terrible, unimaginable time for the entire family and I wish there was more than any collection could do or help with. Power in prayers as the Jay family members conquer all that they are faced with and heal so they can come home and put their precious Faith to rest.     Please share this page and pray as they would do for you and every stranger. Bless you all.   ',\n",
       " '  Hi my name is Melanie, my uncle who is 71 years old and a veteran has been hospitalized for over three weeks with Covid and pneumonia. He is still on a ventilator and has no movement in his hands or feet right now and has a blood clot in one hand.  They are slowly trying to remove him from the ventilator and a feeding tube but he has a long road ahead of him.  He will hopefully be going to a rehab center for a short time before being released. He was in the process of trying to find a new home and will be homeless when he gets out. He needs a warm shelter for himself and his two dogs and his cat Lucy, Lenny, and Luke they are the only joy in his life.  He never married and has no living relatives that can help him but myself.  Please help by donating any amount that you can spare to at least help him find a home or a hotel room for now.  I greatly appreciate all who can help.  Thanks so much!!  ',\n",
       " '  I am doing a fundraiser on behalf of my best friend Chesnee and her family. Chesnee is a 27 year old girl with a wonderful bubbly personality, a smile that will light up any room she enters and still has a LOT of life left to live. She has been hospitalized since before Thanksgiving due to Covid-19(Corona) and was put on a ventilator shortly after to help her breathing as she could no longer breathe well on her own.. As of this week she has FINALLY been taken off the ventilator and is able to breathe on her own but being in and out of the hospital for almost 3 months and being admitted into the hospital for over a month, the medical bills have been racking up with no help and no insurance.. Chesnee and her family are quickly falling into debt and unable to pay the bills coming in since her stay with Covid. The amount we are asking for is just a small dent of what they are going to need for the ongoing pills, tools and medication she is taking/gonna need.. Also now that she is awake, and will still be in the hospital until we hear otherwise.. She is getting very stir-crazy and is asking everyone to bring her things to do as she is tired of playing Sudoku/Crosswords everyday and will probably be hospitalized for a month if not more.. We are taking donations if anybody that can find it in their heart to help out, the money will be going to paying for her hospital stay and medications, as well as buying her a few things to pass the time while she is here. We are also having her make a amazon wish list of things she both wants and needs while she is in the hospital if anybody would like to help with that we will be posting it a later date, now that she is awake and alert enough to make one. Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for any donations you find it in your heart to give. We are also making a special email address for Chesnee to use while hospitalized for anyone that would like to send her words of encouragement, or well wishes and that will also be posted very soon.!**     Thank you!!

       " 'My dad, Cesar Zapata Sr., who meant everything to me, died unexpectedly on May 31st after seven weeks on a ventilator battling COVID-19.   In early April, my mom and dad and I all started experiencing mild COVID-19 symptoms. Within a few days, my symptoms and my dad’s became severe and we both went into the hospital. I was soon sent home to recover with my mother but my dad‘s symptoms were bad enough that he needed to remain hospitalized. Not long after he was admitted, he was put into an induced coma so that the doctors could give him enough oxygen to keep him alive through a ventilator. The next seven weeks were harrowing for me and my mom. She was starting to recover but I was still exhausted from the virus. The doctors were taking excellent care of my dad and we kept hoping each day that he would start to get better and come home. Some days his oxygen levels would get a little higher but the next day they would be bad again. We stayed positive. We had to be positive. I took on the responsibility of communicating every day with the hospital staff and translating everything for my mom and for my dad’s family in Peru. My dad continued to receive unemployment payments and, as the bills arrived, I struggled to figure out how to take care of all of our family’s financial obligations. I’m only 19.  We knew that my dad’s condition was getting worse – that there were holes in the lining around his lungs (the “parietal pleura”) from being intubated for so long and because of his body’s weak state. But we thought he could make it. He couldn’t. The openings caused air to enter the cavity between his lungs and the pleura, causing immense amounts of pressure that led to cardiac arrest. His body gave up on the last Sunday morning in May.   My mom and I have no family in the United States except each other. I arranged to have my dad’s body cremated so that, someday, when I can travel again, I will be able to take his ashes to Peru. We used to live in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn until a few years ago when we moved to the north shore of Staten Island. We’ve started to build some community in Staten Island but we are no longer a short walk from our Sunset Park friends – from the kids and teachers I knew at PS 172, MS 88, and Fort Hamilton High School. I never imagined anything this difficult before in my life. Sometimes my mom and I feel like our situation is impossible – that we’re all alone. I know that we’re not.   My dad’s unemployment stopped arriving the day he died. We have no source of income. My dad’s death has left my mom and I devastated and also in extreme financial hardship. We’ve resorted to putting together this GoFundMe page to help us with immediate expenses. No donation would be too small and anything you provide will be greatly appreciated.   Please feel free to share our page.   Thank you, Cesar (Jr.) and Yenni Zapata',\n",

       " '  We are coming together to help fundraise what we can for our dear friend, mother, fiancé, daughter, sister, co-worker and loved one Bonita Gutierrez.         Bonita is a true caretaker, kind to all, selfless, full of spunk and true to herself. She is a dedicated mother to her 3 year old daughter Guin, the bestfriend of nearly ten years to her fiancé Jesse and and the pride and joy of her mother and father. As a loving and loyal friend I know she has touched many of our lives giving us a much needed laugh, listening ear and so much more.         Anyone that knows her well knows she is a fighter at heart and right now she is fighting the fight of her life.    She is currently hospitalized and on a ventilator with COVID 19. Her situation is fragile, there have been some scares but the doctors have been amazed to see her pull through. She has recently been showing some improvements.         We want to come together during this time to help support her loved ones that are attempting to make it through this difficult time. We are believing for a miracle and she is already defying the odds but the doctors are predicting that recovery is going to be a long road.         The primary purpose of this collection is to assist with medical bills but also to help supplement the family. Currently Bonita remains utilizing a temporary insurance which is scheduled to expire in September. Even with insurance, copays will add up quickly but after September she will likely pay out of pocket. We are unsure of what to expect with any sort of COVID relief assistance. She has been in ICU for several weeks. These hospital bills add up fast and the doctors are certain that after discharge there is going to be a long road to a full recovery. That will likely include physical therapy or other interventions. This has put the responsibility of provision solely on her fiancé Jesse for the foreseeable future. Some of the money we use may be used to help assist with the needs of the family as they are reduced to one income. Currently the family has been working together to provide child care for Guin, soon work schedules will need to resume and day care will become necessary. While this list is not all inclusive, it is meant to  give a sense of the various needs the money may be applied to.         We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for anything you are willing and able to contribute.  ',\n",

I ran into his room to help him and could tell immediately that he just had a stroke or had recently had one. The ambulance arrived a short time later and his blood pressure was so high that they could not even get a blood pressure reading. He was taken to the hospital and his condition deteriorated to the point where doctors and nurses did not think he would live through the night. CT scans showed two major strokes and couple of smaller ones, leaving him partially paralyzed on his left side. He had blood clots in his leg and lung, arterial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, fand COVID. He had to be put on a ventilator and we had no idea what type of damage strokes have caused. Every day, every breath since that day has been a struggle for my dad but we remain hopeful that he will recover and come back to us the way we know him. Over the next several days his condition improved enough where he was successfully taken off of the ventilator on December 23. As we navigate through the next days, weeks and months, we do not know how we will be able to pay for our bills as well as his medical bills which will only be partially covered by his medical insurance. He will most likely not be able to work again, and we were advised to look into taking steps forward into filing for disability.

We \\xa0just never expected this to happen to him. Unfortunately, I am left alone to pay all of our bills, which I am struggling to do because I am working 40-60 hours for an externship, and many companies I applied to work for will not work around my college schedule. I may have to be forced to put my externship on hold if I cannot find a job that is willing to work with me on my schedule as I have to pay bills on my own at this point.\\xa0 The hospital expects my dad to be there until at least February 1st and then he will most likely have to go to a rehabilitation facility to help him regain strength and get better . He may also need home health care in the future . Our monthly bills are around $1,000 and the billing department at the hospital informed us that we are looking at about $800-$1000 daily out of pocket cost for his hospital stay.

Working in an industrial environment, you get to see a lot of people who use their overbearing personalities in order to motivate others into action. However, Alfredo was the type of person who could motivate people into action through his example of hard work and his kind and peaceful disposition. He always had a smile that could immediately ease any tense or stressful moments in the office. As I got to know more about Alfredo, I found out that he got this joy and inner peace from his Christian faith. He embodies what the scriptures say in Ephesians 4:32, \"Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.\"     In August, Alfredo was hospitalized for Covid-19 and was eventually placed on a ventilator. In late September as his lung functions improved, he woke up from his medically-induced coma and was able to see his wife and 4 kids on video call. Unfortunately, he passed away a week later.

We want to provide a good funeral for him and we also have to take on his finances.          For those who do not know, my father, Michael has currently been hospitalized on a ventilator fighting severe COVID pneumonia since May 7th. he is now off the ventilator and recovering, This virus has taken a huge toll on his body, his kidneys took a hard hit as well as his circular and vascular system. He will also have to have both his legs amputated they will try to save as much of his feet as they can. He still has a great quality of life ahead of him and has survived a virus that should of killed him.   The financial aspect of his treatment never stops growing as we fight for him to get better. Those of you who know him knows he would give all he had to someone in need, given that he had something to give. To some he is a friend, uncle, brother, and/or son, but to six kids he’s “Dad” and to two sweet little kids, “Pop-Pops,” as their grandfather. His aggressive treatment will continue into the following weeks.  We are hoping to raise $10,000 dollars to help offset him for not working, as he has worked almost 40 years doing the job he loved he will have to give that all up due to his body taking the hit it has and his legs being amputated. we are also having todo many renovations to his home. maybe you cant donate but you know someone who can help in the renovation to help him live a more normal life.  Every dollar counts and is very much appreciated by his family as we hold on to hope that he will continue this fight and return home to us and eventually the life he very much wants to live. It will take about a year for him to learn to walk again and to get back to the things he loves.  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389233834786_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389233834786_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389263221367_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389263221367_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389479998556_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389479998556_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389619286002_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389619286002_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389657698880_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389657698880_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_158938968620059_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_158938968620059_r.jpeg\"     /        img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589400520331234_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589400520331234_r.jpeg\"     /   ',\n",
       " 'Hi everyone.  A group of friends have started a Go Fund me account to help provide some support and love for Tammy Welbes and her family.    Tammy has always had a huge heart and has helped so many people through her work and volunteerism.  She worked as a social worker through DHS and LSI.  She has been a very active member of the Jaycees and all of their projects including Toys for Kids, the July 3rd Fireworks, All that Jazz and so many more. Now she needs some of that good karma to come back for her.   Tammy began having significant health issues a couple of years ago.  She has had to get specialized care in Madison and that has been very expensive for her family.  She has also not been able to work because of her health.   Recently, Tammy was diagnosed with COVID-19.  Because of her underlying medical issues, Tammy has had so many complications and is currently hospitalized at Finley hospital in Dubuque with Covid related pneumonia.  She was put on a ventilator as her condition worsened.     We know that Tammy is a fighter and she is going to do everything in her power to get back to her family, friends and community.  She will need to continue to get specialized care and support to recover from both the COVID-19 and her autoimmune health problems.     If you are able to help the family in any way, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you do not want to send the money through the Go Fund Me account and would rather send it directly, just message Lisa Foley Thormann to make arrangements.    Thank you Tammy’s good friends  ',\n",

       " \"  Edwin Yu was a beloved son, loving husband, and proud father of 2 children.     He was hospitalized in December 2020 due to COVID. For several weeks he was on a ventilator fighting the virus, but by a true miracle, Edwin survived his battle with COVID. However things were still difficult for him in the weeks after he was COVID free. He had suffered a heart attack at the hospital and had to have a tracheotomy so that he could breathe easier after the virus wrecked his body.     Eventually he was transferred to a nursing facility in Topanga from February to March. During this time my mom and I visited twice a week (even though we were only allowed one a week) bringing him food and spending time with him during his rehabilitation. But we could only ever see him through a glass window, and with every visit his determination to come home grew more and more.     By the end of March, his doctor gave us the ok to have him come home. It was nothing short of absolute joy that he experienced being surrounded by his family in his own home these last couple of months. My brother, Tyler, flew in for 2 weeks to celebrate his birthday and care for him alongside my mother and I. We thought that even if it was a long journey, he would get better and we as a family would do anything to help in his healing.     But as May came around his pain grew to be too much. He experienced neuropathy pain all over his body as well as difficulty breathing due to COPD. But he still tried to keep a brave face telling extended family there was nothing wrong. Only those of us at home could hear his aches and complaints as his body failed him. He may have survived COVID, but he never truly healed. The virus did unimaginable damage to his entire body, and although he wanted to keep fighting, even the strongest survivors grow weary from relentless pain everyday.     Looking back after the shock has settled down, we realize that maybe he knew his time was almost up. Our family never considered that he could leave us so soon, but he was the only one who truly knew the extent of his pain everyday. Edwin found solace though by living the last couple of weeks to his fullest. He ate all his favorite foods, enjoyed his signature Starbucks drinks, and watched all the movies he loved in his youth. He loved his wife who cared for him 24/7, and continued to dote on his children who were never far from his reach. If he was going to live, he was going to live his way.     Despite the tragedy of his passing, Edwin was home. Since the moment he woke up in the hospital to the second he left the nursing facility, all he wanted was to be in the home he built and made with his family. He deserved more time, but God was gracious enough to give him enough to come back home to us even for a couple months.     We created this GoFundMe to help us relieve the financial burdens of handling his funeral. It is painful enough to lose him so soon, but he wouldn't want us to drown in debt to honor his memory. Funds will go towards all funeral and memorial expenses in the coming weeks. Any additional funds we receive will help us care for our home as Edwin was the main provider for the family. The last thing he could ever want is his family losing our home. If you could open your hearts to helping our family in our time of grieving, we would be immensely grateful.  \",\n",

       " '  Hi, my name is Bonnie and my 28-year-old son with chronic kidney disease and tachycardia , is hospitalized and on a ventilator with severe Covid-19 here in Bakersfield, California. The only contact we have is through virtual visits on an IPad where he can listen to my voice and we can see each other. This is the only time he’s ever been hospitalized since he was 16 years old that I can’t be there in person to support him emotionally.     During an unprecedented time as now with the rise in Covid-19 hospitalizations for those impacted with severe Covid-19 infections, imagine being isolated and alone in the ICU with this disease and no visitors being allowed due to Covid-19 restrictions and how much fear/anxiety this creates for someone. Imagine the feelings of joy and relief of being able to see your loved ones and obtain support via Virtual Family Visits through electronics (IPad, Tablet) and the sense of comfort that brings.      span style=\"font-size:1.0625rem;\" Praise God for another day and an opportunity to make a difference in those severely affected by COVID-19, hospitalized in ICU. YOU’RE HELP IS NEEDED!! IPAD or tablets desperately needed! My boyfriend, Sean Cummings, came up with this amazing fundraising idea and what a blessing it would be for patients isolated in ICU with no means to visit with their loved ones to be able to connect virtually. Turn heartbreak into HOPE.       span style=\"font-size:1.0625rem;\" Currently the hospital my son is hospitalized at with COVID-19 is a 30-bed ICU unit with only ONE I-pad for virtual visits with families to be shared between all 30 patients. There is something we as a community can do to change this!      Putting my energy into helping others who are isolated in ICU’s, like my son, in order to connect with family via virtual ICU visits on IPads or Tablets, is the goal of this fundraiser. The electronics will be donated to the hospital ICU for current and future patients who are hospitalized with severe, life-threatening conditions.     Research studies have shown that family engagement is extremely important and has a positive impact on patient outcomes. A family-centered approach provides an opportunity for family members to be engaged more efficiently and effectively. With the no-in person-visit policy in place because of Covid-19 restrictions, the most vulnerable patients, those like my son in ICU, can wait hours for the one IPad to come available so their family/friend support can be contacted for virtual visits and help these patients have HOPE.     Those fighting for their lives NEED hope, support, familiar faces and voices, for their psychological well-being to promote holistic healing. I know for a fact that when isolated and hospitalized this often results in depression and hopelessness, which directly impacts the speed and rate of the bodies healing ability.     Using Virtual ICU technology not only provides more accessible technology for the patient, but also poses less of a risk of infection for health care workers, even though some patient assistance could be needed depending on the severity of the patient’s condition.     Let’s be a part of something bigger than ourselves! Whose with me? Any amount is appreciated and will be used to purchase electronics to be donated to the hospital as funds are received. God bless and stay safe ❤️  ',\n",
       " '  On 8/4/21 Julian Sanchez came down with COVID-19. He was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator. Things were very grim there for awhile as it looked like he was not going to pull through this. He remained on a ventilator for several weeks before he eventually began to make some progress. Over 3 weeks went by with little progress and we feared for the worst. Thanks to some aggressive medications and medical heroes,  he was able to pull through and began to make progress. He was brought out of the medical coma and began responding. Once he was aware of what was going on, he suffered a cardiac arrest. He recovered from this only to have an intestinal issue which lead to a major surgery. God was on his side and probably his his father too (who we lost to COVID-19 earlier this year). By the grace of God he was returned to us.         Currently he is in a rehab center in Davenport recovering. He has a long road ahead of him.  Weak but still has that Julian sarcasm.         Julian is a family man, takes pride in his 3 children, Deanna, Cynthia and Julian, his wife Maribel. He has 2 grand children, Ben and Penelope who light up his world. Julian has always been there for his family and now he needs our help. He has been unable to work since 8/4/21 and it is unsure when he will have the strength to get back to work. His saving is depleted and donations would help him on his road to recovery.         Please considering donating to Julian to help the family with some financial burdens and relieve some stress from them as he make his come back.  ',\n",

       " '   Hello, my name is Tiffany. I’m Greg’s sister..      For those of you that don’t know him, he’s an Army Veteran and a Father of two to Dylan-18 and Rebecca-17.      I’m starting this go fund me account because as you know, anything unexpected leaves worry about how to pay the bills.      As his sister, I want to do everything I can to make this easier on him because he’s gonna have a long road of recovery ahead of him.      Greg was confirmed COVID positive September 13, 2021. He was hospitalized on Sept. 19 then was admitted to the ICU a week later on Sept. 26 with two chest tubes and maxed out on oxygen. Just a few days after that on Sept. 29, he was intubated. Placed on a ventilator.. He has COVID pneumonia as well as a blood clot on one of his lungs and subcutaneous emphysema. But, he is starting to show signs of improvement!!      I know it’s going to be very difficult physically and mentally when he returns home with not being able to return to work as soon as he would like and I’m sure he’ll need physical therapy along with whatever else comes with the recovery of COVID.. If y’all could, no matter how big or small, any donation is appreciated!! This will cover whatever he may need. Bills, medications, etc.      He’s been through the wringer and I don’t want him to worry about anything or be focused on anything else when he gets out other than getting better and stronger!!          UPDATE Oct. 18th:    He’s still on the ventilator, now he has a trach connected to the ventilator. He was doing great but his lungs collapsed and it forced the trach out which was connected to his ventilator. He coded and they had to revive him. He was without oxygen for a few minutes and he is now having seizures. They will be doing an eeg and ct scans to get a better look at his brain. Everyone please pray!!  ',\n",
       " 'Last Wednesday, 11/25 my beloved husband Fred was admitted to the hospital with breathing problems. He is in ICU sedated and on a ventilator for non-covid symptoms. The hospital is still trying to determine what is causing Fred’s breathing issues. A biopsy of his lungs was performed and we are waiting for the results. Because of the pandemic, my son and I aren’t even allowed to be by his side. We aren’t sure how long he will need to be hospitalized and unfortunately Fred does not have medical insurance and not only is the primary breadwinner of our family but he owns his owns business. Therefore, he doesn’t have sick time he or FMLA he can rely on. Because we both work, we don’t qualify for medical assistance or hospital charity. He was released from the hospital (praise the Lord) today 12/5/2020 with a stack of prescriptions to fill, a cane, and a number for home respiratory therapist. We are still waiting for the biopsy results to find out what is causing his breathing issues. The doctors have ruled out COVID. He works in construction (stone mason) and is not able to work  in the state he is in. I know times are tough for most right now and appreciate any help toward his treatment and medical bills. Thank you for your kind words and prayers as well. My son Eric and I are trying to work as much as possible to help pay for these bills and prescriptions. One of us has to alternate who is able to be home with him because he can’t do much for himself yet. We know that his healing will take some time and there will be a long road to recovery. We aren’t even celebrating Christmas this year. We are just happy to have him alive and well. I will keep adding updates on Fred’s condition here as much as possible. We thank you in advance for any and all- kind words, prayers and even sharing this to your social media site. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. ',\n",
       " '  As most of you know, Duane Pesice , the editor of Oxygenman Books and friends to hundreds if not thousands of writers and artists, has contracted Covid and is now in the ICU on a ventilator. So far, he is doing ok all things considered but he needs help not only for when he gets out but also to assist his friend Denise in caring for his kitty brood while he is ventilated and hospitalized. Please assist in any way you can.  Denise will make sure the money is allocated correctly and will continue to make sure his wee fur friends have food, water and pets whilst Duane is incapacitated.    Duane has helped many writers like myself to get their start in publishing and without him, the world would be a much uglier and nastier place as well as less fun.     Please help Duane and keep sending good thoughts his way as well.  Every little bit helps~    Sarah, Denise and Kitties       ',\n",
       " '  My name is Staci Wolfford. I am trying to raise money for my precious friend, Kristi Skinner Neff. Kristi was hospitalized August 31, 2021 with Covid. On September 11, she was placed on a ventilator. She is still on the ventilator, but is alert &amp; aware of all that is going on around her. Since she has been off work for so long, her insurance is about to expire. She needs to be moved from Beaumont to Houston to a longer term care facility to recover. Her family is working on securing some type of insurance, but have not been successful thus far. I pray that if you are able to donate that you would &amp; if not, that you would please lift Kristi in prayer. She is a mother, niece &amp; dear friend. She is a Christian lady &amp; would give someone the shirt off her back. She is strong &amp; usually fiercely independent. She really needs our help to get the attention she needs.

       "['   My little brother Dustin was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at the age of 12. He has taken good care of himself and has not been admitted to the hospital since that diagnosis.            Dustin is now 43 years old. He spent his birthday, December 27th, on the couch fighting Covid. He continued to say he did not want to go to the hospital in fear of being placed on a ventilator and never waking up again. However, on January 1st his oxygen levels dipped into the 70’s and his girlfriend forced him to let her take him to the hospital. When they arrived his oxygen was at 58. He is now in the ICU putting up the fight of his life.            My brother has no health insurance. I know he’s worrying about that while he’s in the hospital, alone, fighting to get better. I’d like to take that weight off his shoulders because he’s carrying enough right now.            I am pleading to everyone out there who has a brother, a Dad, or any family member that is larger than life to please help my baby brother. (He would hate me referring to him as that, but that’s what he will always be to me). He gives the very best hugs. He would do anything for anyone. He’s a really good Dad and loves his two kids more than life itself. I know he’s fighting to get back home to them.            If you are able, please donate. And if you are not able, please pray for him. Send some positive vibes to him and all of his family. Because I don’t know what this world would be like without him in it.            Thank You so much,      Nicole Goyzueta   ',\n",
       " \"  My nephew, Daniel, is 32 years old. He is a Volunteer Firefighter with House VFD. He is a full time dispatcher for Amistad Freight and part time dispatcher for Union Police Department.     On, Tuesday, January 11, Daniel tested positive for Covid. By Thursday, after taking the recommended supplements, he felt much better. On Friday, he awoke with what he thought to be a painful cyst and began to run fever and experience nausea. After a long, stressful day in the E.R. on Sunday,with Daniel having fever of 104, they were told that he needed emergency surgery; he had sepsis.     That would be the first of five surgeries, in which the doctors would go in to remove necrotic (or dead tissue), in 12 days. Those first few day, brought news of a rare form of necrosis associated with diabetes, sepsis and unimaginable pain. Very few know that in the beginning the doctor gave a 40% chance of death if the surgeries were not successful in removing the necrotic tissue. My sister, Richelle, never left his side. Throughout this journey she has been his constant champion, counselor, care giver and confidant.     Because of the amount of dead tissue that was removed, Daniel was left with a huge gaping wound and the insertion of a machine called a wound vac.     Paperwork that Daniel signed, estimated a hospital bill of over $800,000. Daniel does not have health insurance. He will need to go to Wound Care, two to three times per week, each appointment, he is expected to pay $54.     Daniel has been off work since January 11th and it is unclear when he will be physically able to return to work.     Richelle has taken off work to tend to Daniel's daily needs and to get him to and from his wound care appointments.     Daniel is one of the most private people that I have ever known and was reluctant to agree to allow fundraising. That's who he is. Humble, hardworking, and honest.     I am asking that you consider being a blessing to Daniel and Richelle, and help ease some of this huge bill that looms ahead.     In addition to the $800,00 hospital bill, there will be multiple doctor and wound care appointments, medical treatments, supplies and medications as well as food, utilities, etc.     Please, continue to pray for Daniel, for healing and relief from pain.     Thank you and God bless each of you! Brenda     \\xa0  \",\n",
       " '   My name is Julia and I am starting this fundraiser for my dad Julio Guevara. My dad has always been a hardworking man who has always provided for his family. Aside from that he is such an amazing dad who along with my mother has always strived for us to become the best by showing us values and principals. On May 9th, 2021, my dad became very ill and had to be taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with COVID-19. When we took him to the hospital, he was extremely hypoxic (shortness of breath, wheezing, confusion, blue lips, and oxygen saturation of 70%). He was immediately put on oxygen and given Remdesivir. At first, he reacted fine to the oxygen and Remdesivir, but 4 days later his condition became worse, and he needed to be put on a ventilator. Based on the evaluation from the doctors we were told that more than likely he was not going to make it and he would eventually pass away while on a ventilator. Due to the hospital policy changes due to COVID-19 we were only allowed to talk to him on the phone and facetime him. The hospital was kind enough to let us talk to my dad before he was put on a ventilator, and we were able to give him some words of encouragement before he was sedated. It was one of the worst experiences we have gone through as a family, but we managed to get through it and give him some words of encouragement and also to let him know how much he meant to us.            On May 13th, 2021, my dad was put on a ventilator. Despite the doctor’s evaluations my dad continued to improve and 14 days later he was able to come off the ventilator and the doctors decided to place a tracheostomy (an opening surgically created through the neck into the trachea (windpipe) to allow direct access to the breathing tube). My dad continued to improve overall over the next couple of weeks. Due to him being bed bound, his muscles started to waste which led to him becomes weak and unable to stand on his own. My dad basically had to learn how to walk, feed, and dress himself again. My dad was finally able to come home on August 31st, 2021. Once at home my dad did continue to improve but taking care of him became difficult due to his needs, but as a family we managed to care for him.            Shortly after my dad ended up in the hospital again and was diagnosed with Post-COVID-19 Cholangiopathy (Liver chemistry abnormalities, liver scarring,) which affected my dad more due to his continuous recovery from COVID-19. Since October of 2021 my dad has been in and out of the hospital because his condition continued to worsen. My dad’s liver function testing (blood tests used to help diagnose and monitor liver disease or damage) has been abnormal continuously and because of this his liver has continued to scar. He has had to have multiple Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and have stents put in place to help with his liver issues. In November of 2021 we were told that he was going to need a liver transplant due to the continuous scarring and abnormal lab values that doctors were not able to manage with other medical remedies. His care was transferred over to Georgetown Transplant center. My dad is now in need of a liver transplant and unfortunately because of his insurance which is still pending he is unable to do the transplant work-up as well as be put on a list.            We have been working to get my dad insurance since he was hospitalized back in May of 2021. My dad’s insurance terminated in April of 2021 due to him becoming part time at his job. Unexpectedly all this happened, and we have been trying to get Medicaid for him. The Medicaid process has been tough to deal with because they require a massive amount of information and even if the smallest amount of information is missing, they deny the application. It’s been about 9 months now and his Medicaid is still pending. As you can imagine we are now responsible to pay for all medical bills from May until now which is almost over $500,000. Due to this Medicaid application still pending my dad is unable to start the process for his liver work-up testing and is not able to be put on a transplant list until this is resolved. My dad is currently at Georgetown Transplant center and has been there since January 6th, 2022. The doctors and staff are doing what is within their hands to keep my dad healthy enough and strong enough to keep him going until he is able to get on a transplant list. This insurance process is what has everything at a standing point.            My mother has been taking extra shift to help pay for his medical bills, at least the small ones and my brother and I have tried to pick up shifts to help in anyway we can, but unfortunate it’s been difficult to keep up with all the bills pilling up. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my dad’s story. We thank you in advance for any help that can be given.                            img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62969099_1643501227421595_r.\"   /             img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62969099_164350301038327_r.\"   /             img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62969099_1643502989462181_r.\"   /      ',\n",
       " '  Hello everyone, my name is Maria Martinez. A young women with big dreams in life. I will tell you a little about myself, I am a single mother and I also have the responsibility of taking care of my 4 nieces who were orphaned, their their father Arnold died in a traffic accident, a truck ran over him at a crossroads, the driver of the truck he lost control and swerved out of his lane, running a red light and taking the girl’s father with him. The truck’s license plates were fake and the driver fled the scene.  leaving Arnold nearly dead Unfortunately he later died in the hospital and no one  answers for the life of Arnold.  I made a commitment and promised to work hard to get the girls ahead. But  in May 2021 COVID came into my life causing serious health problems.I was hospitalized very seriously...   I was left with many consequences. I was in rehab for 7 months. I lost my job, the rented place where I lived and I lost everyone who claimed to be my friends. When I was a healthy, beautiful woman with a good job. But after being completely penniless where were no more friends. They all turned their backs on me. I still can’t work, because if I walk for 5 minutes I get out of breath, I feel like I’m not the same person I was before. But I don’t want to die without fulfilling the promise. Because they are like my daughters. and I have to fight for my 10 year-old son and my children. I want and desire to recover for them. But after contracting COVID my life had to start from scratch. I have high medical bills to pay. And today I want to ask you whit all my heart to give me your support. Any amount will be well received, I want to keep the promise I made to the girls to buy their house and also to pay my medical expenses. I trust that God will touch his heart and from today thank you very much for helping and being part of this dream. I am sure that with your help this will be possible. God bless you all.

The treatment he is needing is very expensive so anything helps .         Jose Gonzalez my brother in law is at Winter Haven Hospital in Winter Haven Fl he is in need of a ECMO bed , he is a 35 year old man with no underlying issues that is fighting for his life in winter Haven hospital in Polk County Fl because of covid , but because cases are so high we cannot find a hospital that has a ECMO bed available for him to be able to get the right treatment he needs . Right now he has been 16 days on a medically induced coma because of covid on a ventilator they have done all the treatments they could think of but his oxygen has gotten really low . At this point last thing left to try besides prayers is the ECMO that only certain hospitals have but because they are short staffed and have no beds available he cannot be transported. Covid is no joke and people need to realize that .If y’all are able to share his story and maybe be able to get a hold of a bed available for him faster than us it would be greatly appreciated.My name is Yoelda De Lira my number is (863) [phone redacted].My sister Mary Estrada is his wife and they have two young daughters 10 and 11 years of age .Please share and pray for my brother in law .

The the impact on her health will most likely be permanent, with many elements taking years to approach her pre-virus levels of functionality. Her family also faces mounting hospital bills and the burden of expenses necessary for her health that simply did not exist in their budget before this tragedy.         Her friends and family are asking you to donate what you can to help us reach our goal to aide Michelle in her recovery. She is an incredible educator who has devoted her life towards giving her students the best opportunity to thrive in a challenging world.

Her condition was so bad at one point that while she was hospitalized in the intensive care unit she could not talk, and had to ask for help from HR to call the short term disability office every day to report her which was hard to find.  In PACU, caring for her patients, Julie was unable to socially distance from her patients. Her role as their nurse was to support and maintain her patient\\'s airways which often meant she was within arms reach encouraging them to cough and breathe deeply- all while the patient was unmasked. She had reservations re-wearing her single-use surgical mask for weeks on end, but Julie took the PPE and precautions seriously. She donned her surgical mask, face shield, and gloves with every patient. She frequently washed her hands while providing care to her patients. She socially isolated outside of work. Yet, she still contracted COVID-19. Furthermore, because her patients were predominantly outpatient, there was no clear patient to connect her infection to so the hospital denied her COVID pay. \\xa0 Since her discharge home from the hospital, she is still requiring oxygen. She reports struggling with many lingering symptoms that are often categorized with the catch-all term of \"brain fog.\" Symptoms such as extreme fatigue, cognitive changes, vertigo, and chronic shortness of breath have made her day to day life more difficult than she could imagine']\n",

He’s staying an additional 8 days for observation; and on Sunday, he will be moved home by ambulance, due to his oxygen dependency. He will need two additional weeks of 24 hour care from home, with physical therapy for his breathing. Unfortunately, in Nicaragua, insurance agencies are not covering any sort of Covid care, and all hospitals have to charge a premium for coronavirus related treatments. Pavel entered the ICU with his C-reactive proteins at 400 (100 is considered life threatening ), and in his x-rays they saw that 95% of his lungs were showing inflammation brought on by his preexisting condition and the Covid-19 infection. He was put on immunosuppressant steroids, and he needed a plasma transfusion to help his body fight off the infection. Regrettably his blood type was not available. They worked on building up his breathing exercises but, after three days of little improvement, the decision was made to put him on a non-invasive oxygen ventilator to supplement his breathing, with the possibility of having to be intubated and put on an invasive ventilator. Pavel is not the kind of person to give up, even with everything against him after 2 days on the mask Pavel’s numbers started improving, he started normalizing his breathing, talking more, and even standing and walking on his own. Pavel is slowly on the road to full recovery but moving him home is going to be a new set of challenges. Due to his compromised immune system, he will need to quarantine further. He will be dependent on oxygen, corticosteroids for inflammation, Kitoscell for scarring, round the clock care, and daily physical therapy. He has not been able to work since his hospitalization and, will not be strong enough to return to work for several weeks. Additionally, medical bills are close to $35,000 plus $1,200 for his full time care, $750 for physical therapy, and over $2,000 just for oxygen and medications.

He was put on a ventilator because his lungs were so damaged.\\xa0 \\xa0 Harold\\'s wife, Diane, received the call that no family wants to get from a hospital. They told her that Harold was starting to crash, his kidneys were no longer functioning, and it was only a matter of time before he coded.  After the family arrived at the hospital, they told her only two people would be allowed to go into the isolated room to be with him.\\xa0 Diane and their oldest son Phil had to quickly suit up in personal protective equipment and had to wear a \"helmet” that provided them with their own air supply.\\xa0\\xa0  Diane and Phil finally could touch him and tell him they loved him, and it was okay because God was calling his name.\\xa0 Harold died within ten minutes with them by his side.\\xa0 They are certain that Harold could feel and hear them. This was the first time since Harold was hospitalized on Oct 9th, 2020 that any family member was able to be with him due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, there was one day when the family was able to stand outside his hospital window to see him and talk to him on the cell phone. \\xa0To do this, they had to break hospital rules and go through a restricted area to get to his window. This was shortly before he was put on a ventilator. Although the family would not normally break rules, they were desperate to see their loved one.         Harold was a man with a huge heart, a big smile, and tons of hugs to give. He always brought a smile to the faces of anyone he came into contact with and the most important and deepest connections were the ones with his family.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/52110076_1607300981558150_r.jpeg\" alt=\"52110076_1607300981558150_r.jpeg\"     /  He leaves his wife of 40 years, Diane Nowlin, seven sons-Mike, Jeff, Randy (deceased), Phil, Jared, Cody, Travis, and one daughter, Stephanie James as well as several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/52110076_1607301017648944_r.jpeg\" alt=\"52110076_1607301017648944_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/52110076_1607301135789177_r.jpeg\" alt=\"52110076_1607301135789177_r.jpeg\"     /  Diane, a widow at only 57, is going to need financial assistance for a short while to keep up with her monthly bills.

       "['  Hi, my name is Sam, and you might’ve seen my story on Facebook! I got COVID, was in the hospital for 366 days, and went through so much medical trauma. Now that I’m home, I’m currently dependent on oxygen. We have 2 tanks and a regular converter. But when it’s time for me to go out in public or to my doctors’ appointments, I’ll have to haul a giant tank with me. I’ve never done anything like this before, but I didn’t know a portable oxygen machine would be so expensive. The smallest donations would help me get this machine and reduce the burden of the other medical bills my family and I have to work through.         Thank you so so so much for even taking the time to read this!  ']"

       "[\"  I honestly never imagined that my family would be put in a position where we would need to be so vulnerable. Like a lot of people, Covid has impacted our family in a way that will change us forever .     \\xa0     Two weeks ago, my dad was happy and healthy. Riding his bike around his neighborhood and sending me his workout badge for the day, telling me how many miles he had just completed.     \\xa0     My dad managed to stay healthy during this pandemic. On Friday, Jan 14th, he started with a very mild headache. I took him immediately to our family doctor. We had a plan, which included keeping him out of the hospital. His symptoms ebbed and flowed over the next few days, but he was stable and ok. By Wednesday, he started having neurological symptoms that required an ER visit. He was treated and sent home. The following 3 days, he became progressively worse, and his O2 went down into the 70’s. We called the ambulance right away to get him to the local hospital. My daughter and I stayed with him the entire night in the emergency room until they could find a hospital that would accept his transfer. I would have never imagined that would be the last time I would see him awake and alert. The transferring hospital refused to let us see him. Our only way of communication was phone calls. My dad needed more and more oxygen, thus making the phone calls very difficult/impossible. None of the hospital treatments were working. On day 3, my dad sent a text that they needed to vent him. He wanted me and my mom’s approval. Although I knew that the outcome would potentially be fatal, I couldn’t deny him as he was struggling. I told him to keep fighting and he told me “I’m trying, it's tough”. He was transferred to the ICU and was vented in 30 minutes. He required the max amount of O2 support the ventilator would give him. The prognosis was very grim. We had the nurse put his phone by his bed and had Psalm 91 play on repeat. We prayed our hearts out for 2 days. We FaceTimed him and read scriptures to him. I really believed that he would overcome this and would be healed as Jesus says in the Bible. Unfortunately, I was wrong. We had to decide as a family to remove all life support as he was not improving.     \\xa0     Saturday, Jan 29 was the day I lost my hero, my support, my cheerleader, MY DAD. I have never felt this kind of pain. It's a pain that is felt deep within my chest and doesn't go away. Our family needs your help as we did not prepare for this type of tragedy. The hospital/ICU charges and funeral arrangements are costly. Any and all support would be very much appreciated.     \\xa0     Thank you so much from the Epplen/Cortese/Mondragon families.  \",\n",
       " '  In Honor of the Castellanos Family Due to the Loss of their Loved One, Mario Castellanos         It is with much sadness that we are fundraising on behalf of the Castellanos Family due to the loss of their loved one, Mario Castellanos.    Mario was a Son, a Brother, a Husband to his beautiful wife Christina and Father of their two darling little boys Mariano (9) and Alexander (3).  To say that he will be greatly missed by all who loved him is an absolute understatement.    Mario had battled cancer 8 years ago and was recently hospitalized in the ICU for over a month due to Covid19.  Regretfully, his condition continued to worsen over time as he had been placed on a ventilator and later induced into a coma.  Due to the damage to his lungs from his previous battle with cancer, he just couldn’t continue to fight anymore.    As you can imagine, his Family is absolutely devastated and although we cannot relieve them of this pain, we would like to help them to find peace in knowing that we are here for them and we care.  At this time, we are asking for donations to help to ease the Family of some of the financial strain incurred with the unexpected medical and funeral expenses.    Thank you so very much for your consideration as any amount donated or even a simple share would mean so very much! Be blessed!    ',\n",
       " 'My grandma was visiting from Mexico she had been here for about three months. She tested positive for Covid on January 17th, a few days later was rushed to the hospital because her oxygen was low. We were hoping she just needed to be in the hospital for a few days. After a week her condition deteriorated, nurses called saying my grandma would not make it past the night. My grandma has always been a strong woman, she was left with 8 children after my grandfather was murdered. She continued to fight for her life a week after her condition deteriorated. Unfortunately, she passed away almost 2 weeks after she went to the hospital. Now we have the bills for the hospital since she was here on a tourist visa, and now we have funeral expenses. We also have to send her back to Mexico where she wanted to rest next to my grandpa. Losing my grandma has been very tough, she was very loving, loved dancing, and would always care about others before herself.',\n",

       " \"  To say 2020-2021 has been a horrible year is an understatement. I’ve always found it morally reprehensible to compare personal struggles. We all have our own issues so I feel awkward setting up this GoFundMe as I have nowhere else to return.     \\xa0     My mother had COPD so I knew she was at high-risk to develop Covid. She raised me mostly on her own as a single mother in a rather rural town in South Dakota. The mentality towards Covid was more lax as neighbors are sprawled over acres of land. She was not particularly concerned about the pandemic. Maybe it’s true but maybe it isn’t. All I know is that she developed Covid in November and was hospitalized for almost two months. In that year total she spent six months in the hospital. She died December 28, 2020, just two weeks before her birthday. She would have been 54.      ***I also want add that the vaccine hadn't come out yet. not anti-vaxxers. There was literally no vaccine. She was desperate for one. But even with her condition, vaccines of any brand, be it J&amp;J, Moderna, and Pfizer dont have huge stocks in small midwestern towns. \\xa0     After returning to NYU in the spring, my grades tanked. When I returned this fall, I lost my academic scholarship because of my abysmal GPA from the previous semester. NYU is not a need-blind school and even the most extenuating of circumstances are not taken into consideration. Not only did I lose my scholarship, I also lost my work-study program. Perversely, because of my mother’s life insurance payment, our family assets were too high to qualify for financial aid this fall semester.     \\xa0     Life insurance is society’s strange way of offering condolences, but it is not the windfall people expect it to be. What did my step-father, brother, and I spend the life insurance on? A funeral, overpriced counseling, paying off medical bills from the four months earlier in 2020 when she had been hospitalized for four months...\\xa0 It wasn't enough and we had to re-mortgage our home. Previously, we had all been on my mother’s insurance. but a month ago, we received a crazy bill in the mail. For most of the pandemic, private insurance companies covered the cost of 90% of covid hospitalization, but that changed in the past three months. Now these insurance companies are charging many families like mine for treatment.     \\xa0     Someone asked me why I don't, after all this tragedy, I transfer out of NYU and attend state school in South Dakota and I want to repond here, because it is a question that deserves an answer.     \\xa0     I am a gay woman. Everyday in high school, I was called a faggot. I sat in the library eating lunch, alone, everyday for four years. I am continuing my education in New York City not out of choice, but necessity. My step-father has only recently started to accept my sexuality but I am still shunned in my hometown. Even at my mother’s wake, I heard a whisper: “there’s the dyke.”     \\xa0     So I am asking for $60,000. Approximately $31,000 will cover the rest of the cost of the medical bills. $5,000 will help pay for my rent and textbooks, and the rest will help re-pay the mortgage on our family home, which we are now several months behind on.       I do hate accepting charity but I’m just not sure what to do. My friend recommended I start this GoFundMe page. Anything helps, really, even if we don’t reach $60,000. I want to properly mourn and heal from the death of my mother without constantly feeling anxious about my family’s financial situation. But I just can’t do it alone anymore.     \\xa0     Thank you for reading this.     ~Laurie     \",\n",
       " '  Hello, I\\'m Adriana, &amp; this is my mom Rebecca\\'s story of her fight against COVID.    As the world continues to battle with COVID &amp; its lasting effects on us all &amp; on our daily life, my mother Rebecca had an up-close &amp; personal battle with it that she\\'s so lucky to have made it out of. As a result, my brothers, along with the rest of our family, &amp; I got to know \\'\\'COVID\\'\\' on a personal level as well &amp; go through/see the damaging effects and marks it leaves on the ones we love and us. COVID has forever changed our family, the way it has the world.         September 28th, 2021, my mother Rebecca was admitted into Shannon hospital with an oxygen level of 40% &amp; entirely out of it, not even able to walk on her own into the hospital. We had no knowledge of what she was battling internally &amp; neither did she; what we \\'\\'thought\\'\\' was a simple cold/sinus infection days before turned out to be COVID pneumonia (delta variant) &amp; would forever change our lives. There were no major signs or symptoms within her that indicated she wasn\\'t producing enough oxygen, let alone having trouble breathing on her own.    Within 48 hours of being admitted, she was placed in the ICU on a ventilator, in a medically induced coma, medically paralyzed, fighting for her life. Our rollercoaster began &amp; most days felt like it wouldn\\'t ever stop or get better. Every day was a struggle, with COVID, you cant go day by day; you have to take it hour by hour; that\\'s how quick this virus is.. after a week and a half of my mom being in ICU on the ventilator, the doctors had reached out &amp; told us that she has a 1% chance at life &amp; wouldn\\'t even give her but maybe six more days of life left before having to take her off the ventilator &amp; for my brothers &amp; I to start making funeral arrangements.    That wasn\\'t an option for us, &amp; we kept our faith and gained the strength to let my mom run her course through this virus; it wasn\\'t her time to leave us or this earth, and we weren\\'t going to let her! My brothers &amp; I had only 30 minutes a day, a walkie-talkie &amp; being on the outside of the glass door as a form of our communication while my mom was in COVID ICU.    After many days of ups and downs, good and bad, after four failed attempts at a tracheostomy, and four heart stops/pauses later, my mother was able to get a tracheostomy placed which then allowed them to begin to wake my mother up and take her off the paralytic &amp; out of a coma. For the first time in 69 days, I got to see my mother with her eyes open. The coma, along with paralytic and no movement for over two months, took a major toll on her, mainly in her hands, she is limited in her mobility in hands at the moment, thanks be to God she is walking &amp; there was no brain damage due to the lack of oxygen. We received the best Christmas present ever and got to bring my mom home on December 24th, 2021! Although she is still on oxygen while at home and still suffers from getting acquainted with everyday life, she perseveres and tries to improve daily, but it\\'s hard for her to get back to normal without proper Rehab. My mother used to be so independent, and now she\\'s been dependent on others, and that\\'s taken a toll emotionally; we are doing this GoFundMe to raise money for proper rehab for my mom, so she can get back to many of the things she loved most (taking care of her grandkids, driving, cooking, and even something as simple as going into a store &amp; to also raise awareness on how severe COVID can be and the long term effects it leaves on those who are hospitalized with COVID &amp; the families &amp; friends that love &amp; care for them. The funds raised will allow her to go into Encompass Rehab here, who, unfortunately, at the time of release, was not accepting her insurance or any charity cases.. Please continue sending lots of prayers &amp; good vibes my mom\\'s way as she has a long road of recovery, but Thanks be to God, he made her a mircale and she is still here, and for that we are forever blessed.

We went from a funeral being on our minds to the nurse calling me this past Sunday telling to come to the hospital because Mom was waking up. It’s been a roller coaster of emotions to say the least.. Mom’s road to recovery will be very slow and long. After she leaves the hospital (St. Anthony’s) she will head to a long term care facility. She still has bills at this time that I wish I could take care of myself but unfortunately can not. Please donate if you can. Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated. We appreciate the prayers and support! ❤️  /font ',\n",
       " '  Hello friends and family,         We have been facing a tremendous amount of emotional stress resulting from economic hardship, loss of family, and an automobile accident, all at the same time.We have suffered from loss of full time sustainable employment due to the pandemic and have had to support all of our financial responsibilities on a single income for the past year and half putting us in extreme financial distress. Some of you may have heard, we were involved in an accident coming home from a band performance this fall. While making a turn our car was side-swiped resulting in us striking a parked car and a telephone pole. We are still healing from our injuries but doing okay. However, our car did not survive and that of another party sustained damage as well. After being totaled by the insurance company and exhausting their coverage we are dealing with the remaining car payments and repair costs of the other vehicle alongside supporting family, whilst now having to acquire yet mpre financial stress with needing to purchase another vehicle. During this time my family had been caring for my grandmother whose health was failing, requiring more than a week’s time off to help my dad, a disabled veteran, prepare for funeral services. She passed on October 22nd 2021.            This is not what any of us expected. In real terms, this means a loss of wages, medical bills, mounting financial hardships, and legal consultations during this time as we try to make ends meet. We have had to cancel band performances, video shoots, and have adversely affected my employment in the short term. We are now reaching out to others that understand the pressures and stresses suffered during this pandemic with family responsibilities and other obligations for any support that can be offered. Though we know that things are slowly getting better in the world, things are not back to normal just yet and many of us are still suffering the effects covid PTSD and the ripple effect it has had on our families.           We thank every single person who has reached out with love and care for your kind generosity, prayers, and positive visualizations. Any help and support during this time is greatly appreciated.        ',\n",
       " 'With deep sadness, we announce that our beloved John Tillery passed away on March 10th from complications due to COVID-19. Our hearts are broken.  John Tillery, husband, father, granddad (Pop Pop), great granddad, brother, nephew, father-in-law, church trustee, and friend, should still be here. He was 85 years old, an Air Force veteran and had multiple underlying health conditions. Unfortunately, he could not get a COVID vaccine in time.  This pandemic is not over. As we prepare to lay John to rest, his grieving wife Helena is still battling COVID. She and the family need your help to cover funeral costs, medical bills, and continuing health care costs when her Medicare coverage steeply declines. 15 days from now, Medicare will only cover 20% of Helena’s time in the in-patient rehab center where she is currently receiving around-the-clock treatment. Additionally, John and Helena had been supporting other family members who are now housing insecure.  The family’s goal is to raise $30,000 to help cover the costs outlined above and provide financial stability once Helena is released from care. She – and the rest of us – are moving forward with hope and faith.  Please give generously; any amount you can contribute will be put to good use and received with profound gratitude. A memorial service is being planned and we will share details shortly. We will also share periodic updates.  Thank you! With love and grace, The Tillery Family',\n",

He was a man of many talents and joys. He worked hard and put his family first. He loved to fish, hunt, and ride his motorcycle. As someone who came from very little, his giant, beautiful heart always pushed him to help others in any way that he could---giving you the shirt off of his back would be an understatement.     \\xa0     His biggest talent was the way he made everyone laugh to the point of tears.

       " 'EDIT: Please read the update. Michael has passed but we still need funds for his medical bills, funeral expenses, and housing security for his wife and daughter.  My cousin, Michael Granato, 56 years old, is currently in the ICU due to COVID complications. This morning our family received news from his nurses that his condition has greatly deteriorated. Michael, a working class Chicano man, does not have solid insurance so the doctors are not doing their best to heal him. We are hoping that with some financial assistance he may have access to better treatment and hopefully find his way to recovery. Even when he hopefully recovers, he and his family will require a great amount of financial support as he is the sole provider for their family and they already live paycheck-to-paycheck; he will be unable to work for quite some time so that he may have time to heal. Should things take a turn for the worst, our family will need help funding funeral expenses and his wife, Jennifer, and 14-year-old daughter, Michaella, will be in need of money to survive on their own.  After over a decade of spending his life in prison and fighting addiction he’s dedicated his life to being the best father and husband he could be, and serving the houseless community even while living in poverty himself. Michael is my cousin via my mother’s sister but before my dad’s mother died he and his wife did everything they could to take care of her. An honest man with a kind heart and the goofiest raspy laugh, it is safe to say that he is one of the most compassionate people I know.  He has always tried his hardest to make sure that no one in his community, be them blood family or the houseless folks around him, goes hungry. He’s spent too many years to count cooking for those who cannot provide food for themselves. He is a truly generous and loving person who works hard to support anyone in need and now he needs our help.  My mother has estimated that Michael and Jennifer will need about $50,000 to assist with his medical bills and any other expenses they may need in these coming weeks/months.

He went into cardiac arrest and passed away on 12/3/2020. He started getting symptoms on Thanksgiving but started getting worse so we advised him to go to the emergency room. My dad was a very proud man and for him to go into the hospital was a big deal and means he didn't feel good.\\xa0 As I am writing this tears are streaming down my face and I can hardly see but I am trying to be strong for my mother Yvonne Montes. My father didn't have a life insurance policy, they denied him so we are asking for help for the funeral cost and burial. I know these are difficult times for everyone but anything will help. Our family is so heartbroken and devastated at this loss and we appreciate everyone who has reached out to us. We know you all wish to be with us but being that my mom is getting over COVID herself makes it difficult. We love you family and friends.\",\n",

       " \"As you may or may not know, my daddy, James S. Upson, who meant the world to me passed away unexpectedly on July 10th, 2020 due to the Coronavirus. Daddy started showing symptoms in late June and due to his symptoms worsening, my mom and I decided to take him to the hospital on July 5th. He was admitted and immediately diagnosed with COVID-19. However, soon after being admitted he started showing signs of improvement and was then discharged on July 7th. We were all happy to have daddy home and looked forward to his full recovery from the monstrous virus. Unfortunately, our hope was short-lived because he passed away in his sleep on July 10th.   My daddy was my role model! He taught me everything I know, but most importantly, he taught me how to be self-sufficient. Because of him I know how to change a car battery, a tire...things most twenty-two-year-olds nowadays may not know how to do. He taught me how to have an appreciation for life! Unfortunately, his sudden death has deprived me of defining moments including my college graduation, walking me down the aisle, and having my first child; moments I will never get to experience with daddy by my side. All I am left with are memories and a broken heart!\\xa0  Daddy's untimely death has left my mom and me devastated and in extreme financial hardship, which is why we have resorted to this Gofundme page. Your financial support will help us with immediate expenses (i.e., funeral costs, bills, mortgage). No donation is too small, your support will be greatly appreciated!

The whole family has covid along with his other brother in the hospital with the same conditions not knowing if he will make it out of there. I’m asking for help from anyone to help my grandmother pay for the funeral and other expenses left behind on her after my uncles passing. This covid virus has really affected my family leaving my grandma Sick, my other uncle in the hospital, my aunts battling covid in the same home with my cousin Daniel. This is very hard on us because we had lost our loving grandfather at the age of 75 last year to cancer and this year my uncle to COVID-19 at the age of 52 two months before the week of my uncle and is birthday which we spend each year together. I was the niece to my uncle but he never had children of his own but left behind his friendly companion Teddy.

It may be springtime before he can be returned to his family.     Besides his oldest son Johnny, Shane has a 13 year-old son, Dayce. Also devastated by the loss of Shane are his parents Donald and Evelyn Feuerborn, his sister Stacey Clouse and family     Johnny has a great burden on his shoulders. In addition to losing his dad, he is the sole caregiver of his mother, my beloved niece, Mariah Jones.

       " \"   b PLEASE SHARE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS EVEN IF YOU CANT DONATE. JUST BY SHARING YOU ARE HELPING!\\xa0 THANKS SO MUCH!! /b     My aunt Vickie passed away on 11/23/2021 after spending 53 days in SLU Hospitals ICU on a bipap machine because of COVID 19.  On September 23rd she was diagnosed with COVID 19 by her primary care physician. After finding out she had CoVId I made sure to check on her every single day.  Each day she seemed a little worse.  Finally I called her primary care doctor to find out how her vitals were when she was there.  They said her oxygen was only 72.  I don't know why they didn't admit her into the hospital right then but they didn't!!! On October 1st I called over there and she didn't even know who I was and wasn't making any sense what so ever.  I could barely even understand what she was saying.  So I immediately called 911.  They took her to the hospital immediately.\\xa0 \\xa0The doctor said it was a good thing I called when I did because\\xa0 her heart was about to stop.  They got her stable and sent her up to the ICU on a bipap machine using 100% oxygen.  They said she had phenomia and  developed pulmonary fibrosis because of covid.\\xa0 They we're gonna try to wean her off of the bipap machine. They slowly started reducing the amount of oxygen she required and would let her take the\\xa0 full face mask off for hours at a time because she was able to maintain with a regular high flow nasal cannula. She seemed to be doing better until the 7th day or so when she developed a pulmonary embolism.  They caught that in time but not to long after that her right lung collapsed and they had to do an emergency surgery running a tube from her lung.  Then 2 days later her other one collapsed and they had to do the same thing. At this point it was hard for her to even take off the full face mask to eat, drink, take meds anything.\\xa0 They couldn't put a feeding tube in because of the mask.\\xa0 She would be able to take it off and literally try to eat and drink as much as she could in about 10 minutes. That didn't last to long at all.\\xa0 \\xa0About a week later they said that her kidneys were starting to fail because of the meds they had her on to keep the fluid off of her lungs.\\xa0 So her breathing and oxygen was just getting worse.\\xa0 She couldn't take the mask off for a drink or anything.\\xa0 Now they can't give her those meds anymore, which is gonna lead to fluid building back up in her lungs. Let me remind you that during this whole process she was completely with it.  She new exactly what was going on.  She was faced with the decision of whether or not she wants to die peacefully or going through extreme measures to try to keep her alive until something else happened because ultimately there was no other options at this point besides death.\\xa0 She wanted it both ways and I don't blame her because that's just not a decision someone has to make for themselves very often. Most of the time in situations like this someone else is making those decisions for you because most people aren't able to make them theirself. She was miserable but continued fighting. On 11/23/2021 she ended up passing away because even with the BiPAP on at 100% oxygen she still wasn't able to maintain her oxygen level. She also wasn't able to eat or drink in days so she wasnt getting any nutrition. She got sores on her face from the mask being on so long and sores inside her mouth from not having water and the constant nair blowing in her face. I spent every day watching this go on and began thinking maybe I shouldn't have called the ambulance because now it's like shes suffering or being tortured.  It was the worst thing I have seen in my 36 years.  I still can't stop thinking about it. COVID IS REAL AND IT IS TERRIBLE TO WATCH SOMEONE YOU LOVE GO THROUGH SUCH MISERY AND PAIN!\\xa0 After she passed I called the life insurance\\xa0 sshe used and the policy had only\\xa0 been in force for a little over a year so they said they can only pay out 234.00. I know that FEMA Will reimburse me if I can pay for it out of my own pocket but I don't have it to do that.\\xa0 If anyone would like to make payment directly to the funeral home please contact me and I will provide you with the name of the place and any other info you may need.\\xa0 I just want to be able to give my aunt some Peace after her long battle.\\xa0 Please share with your friends and family.\\xa0 Not only to help me with funeral costs but also to help others know what it would be like having a severe case of COVID 19!\\xa0\\xa0  \",\n",

Renea Lynn Rogers has joined her heavenly family, and our family that has gone before her as an angel, to do the greater universal work of God. Her spirit and the love she shared with her family, friends and co-workers will never be forgotten.  My cousin Crystal Clewis’ Mother Renea Rogers has lost her battle with COVID. Renea rapidly deteriorated in the ICU, near her home in Winter Haven, Florida battling COVID during the last couple of weeks in August. As her illness progressed rapidly into September, beyond any reasonable sign of recovery, she passed peacefully early in the afternoon on September 6, 2021.\\xa0  Prior to Renea's battle with this dreadful illness, she shared her home with her Daughter Crystal and her Son-in-Law Daniel. Renea, Crystal and Daniel shared the combined financial responsibilities of owning a home and all associated daily living expenses. As Crystal and Daniel remain behind to pick up the pieces from their tragic loss, medical expenses incurred with Renea's hospital stay and other related expenses will present new unfortunate financial burdens and responsibilities.  Please consider supporting this Go Fund Me to help manage Crystal and Daniel's short-term and long-term financial burden from this crisis, their short and longer-term living expenses, and unforeseen medical expenses.  Crystal, Daniel and Renea always put others before themselves. Crystal and Daniel are in severe need of financial relief at this very difficult time. The sorrow from their loss has not broken their spirit and they continue to share their abundant love and compassion with others.  Our family is truly grateful for any amount you can thoughtfully spare. Thank you again for taking the time to consider our family in this time of need and for your generosity.\",\n",
       " 'I unfortunately am sharing the sad news of the passing of my father, Federico Rombaoa, on July 11th, 2020. After 26 days of fighting for his life in the ICU, he passed due to respiratory and other complications due to COVID-19.  On the morning of June 16th, my brother brought my dad to the ER at Kaiser Anaheim Medical Center due to his symptoms of shortness of breath and inability to breathe. He was then intubated and placed on a ventilator due to his severe respiratory symptoms and very low oxygen saturation levels.\\xa0  Although his initial prognosis was that he would not survive that first night at the hospital in the ICU, my father continued to fight for his life for 26 days. Throughout the duration of his battle, he faced pneumonia, ARDS, atrial fibrillation, UTI, kidney failure/dialysis, and many other complications brought upon by COVID-19. Before the dawn of July 11th, my mother and I received the final call from the ICU doctor at 4:30am that my father “had put up a good fight,” but sadly had passed away at 4:15 am due to shock and complete shutdown of vital organs such as the heart and lungs.  Originally from the Philippines (Ayson, Gerona, Tarlac), my dad was loved by many across the world. He had numerous connections and established many close relationships with family and friends both back in his home country, his immediate family’s home country, and abroad. I am grateful for the family members that were able to share their kind words with my father via video calls to the hospital during his final days.  My father is survived by my mother (Cecilia), my two brothers (Charles, Quincy), and myself.\\xa0  I am writing to humbly ask for your support for my family during this extremely difficult time. In addition to the funeral costs and medical expenses for maximal hospital care for nearly 4 weeks, my family and I also face financial difficulties due to decreased work hours (due to covid and quarantine) and a need to adjust our housing/living arrangements rapidly by the end of July. Our goals are to hopefully offset the monetary costs of my dad’s covid battle and for my mom, Charles, and me to live together under one roof again as soon as possible.  Thank you to the many people who have supported my family during this summer with your phone calls, FB messages, text messages, and prayers. Lastly, I wish everyone love, good health, and safety during this time of pandemic.  On behalf of my family, we are grateful for any sized contribution. You can also donate directly to me (Jaymes) via Venmo (@jaymes-rombaoa).   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_1594494562614884_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_1594494562614884_r.jpeg\" /   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_159449474349404_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_159449474349404_r.jpeg\" /   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_1594494921618081_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_1594494921618081_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_1594494592272403_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_1594494592272403_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_1594494670454222_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_1594494670454222_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_159449470643911_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_159449470643911_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_1594494944257046_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_1594494944257046_r.jpeg\" /   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/49567296_1594494972516281_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"49567296_1594494972516281_r.jpeg\" / ',\n",
       " '  \\xa0On June 3rd, 2021 we lost a great Husband, Father, Son, Brother, and Friend. He is survived by his wife Amy and his 3 kids, Nikolai, Olivia, and Kaylie. As I sit here trying to put words on a blank screen about the type of person Rob (BJ) Tersteeg was, it is difficult because there were so many we don’t know where to start.     After a long hard fight with COVID-19, the Lord decided that it was time for his son to come home, his work on earth was done. After weeks of being in ICU &amp; then being life flighted to U of M, we had to say goodbye.     Anyone that knew Rob knows that he would do anything for anyone, no matter what. Amy and the kids were top priority in his life, even in the ICU he had the nurse go down to the gift shop, to make sure Amy was showered with gifts on her birthday.... and if there was a school or sporting event, he was there. It truly shows the type of guy that he was.     Listening to his jokes, hearing his laugh, or seeing his smile are just a few of the things that we loved so much about Rob. Pulling the kids on the boat aka “Pontuna”, playing arcade 1942, throwing bags at any cornhole tournament we could make, swinging his Randy Jackson ninja sword around asking for something to slice and dice were a few of his favorite things.     We are asking for everyone to come together during this very difficult time and help this beautiful family in any way we can. If you are unable to donate to Rob’s Memorial Fund, please help us share this. We would like to help the Tersteeg family with some of the medical bills, funeral expenses, and any unforeseen bills to follow.     \\xa0     If you have not followed Rob (BJ)\\'s Story on the CaringBridge Site, I have added  the link\\xa0 below.

At the too young age of 29, Aaron passed away from a recent illness. For the past week or so, he had been suffering from a fever, but no one expected it to take his life so suddenly.\\xa0  Aaron was a beloved father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, and friend to many. To know Aaron was to know that he had a heart of gold, always sticking up for the people he cared about. One year he entered a radio contest, writing an essay about why his parents deserved to win a new furnace. Well... his essay won! His efforts got his parents a new furnace that they could not otherwise afford. That was Aaron!  Now, the family is faced with the unexpected burden of funeral expenses and burial costs, without the aid of life insurance. Aaron's father is a paramedic, in the front lines of the CoVid battle. However, he has been off work since last November, recovering from surgery. Aaron's mother is also in the front lines as a nurse, and is currently working two jobs while her husband recovers. The family does not have a dime to spare for this new expense of final arrangements.  All donations will be given to Aaron's parents, to pay for funeral costs and burial expenses. Please say a prayer for Aaron's family at this terrible loss and donate, if you are able.\",\n",

       " '    One of our co-workers, and more importantly one of our friends, lost someone really special to them in a COVID battle on August 27, 2021. None of us were lucky enough to meet the man they called PawPaw but we have heard so many stories and seen pictures of the joy he brought to his family. He loved strongly and supported those around him. He leaves behind his wife, 2 sons, 2 daughters and 19 grandchildren.\\xa0     Pawpaw, his wife and son all caught COVID around the same time, his wife and son became ill but didn’t require hospitalization. After seeing how sick they got, pawpaw wasn’t going to just sit around and feel crummy so he continued to be active, washing his cars and working around his property in hopes that he could work the illness out. Unfortunately one night his cough got the best of him and he couldn’t seem to catch his breath. His wife convinced him to go to the hospital …. Unfortunately he never came home despite being fully vaccinated. After being in the hospital for 2 weeks, his oxygen levels still weren’t improving and they moved him to the ICU and placed him on a ventilator. Unfortunately his kidneys shut down and stopped working. He was given 24-48 hours to live. He was unable to speak and was not comfortable. The Gus family made arrangements to have him be sent home on hospice in hopes that he would have a chance to see some family since ICU visitation was limited due to Covid protocols. Unfortunately, Pawpaw Never made it home leaving the family in complete shock and at a loss on what to do next. In addition to the huge hole his loss has left in the family, they are also trying to navigate how to pay for all the medical bills and funeral expenses as he was the sole provider for his family and recently lost coverage of life insurance and health insurance. Please help our dear friend and her family during this unimaginable time. Please consider a donation, even a small amount, to help to cover hospital bills and funeral expenses. If you are unable to donate please say a prayer for them as they navigate this new way of life. RIP Pawpaw.   ',\n",

       " '  Greetings, I am Jo Lightfeather.  My beautiful, sweet, and gentle husband of 21 years started his journey on Saturday Dec. 11.  The love of my life died in my arms, and I breathed in his last breathe as I was kissing him.         When I was in the most desperate need of protection 20 years ago, he stepped in and became my personal protector.           In early Spring, he started to get sick.  After many tests, he was diagnosed  with Stage IV colon cancer and Stage III lymphoma.  He went to every radiation appt, every chemo appt.   And it was working!  All of his tumors had shrunk and he was ready for surgery.         then he tested positive for COVID days before he was to have surgery,  the surgery was so immediately needed, the docs thought he could still handle the surgery, his temp jumped from 98 up to 102 in 15 minutes.  No surgery.  No hope to have cancer surgery anytime soon.  He had a very aggressive form of colon cancer.  By the time he would recover from COVID enough for more chemo, then surgery, it would be too late for any real hope of cancer recovery.         the COVID caused blood clots in his already weaken heart, it threw blood clots and embolisms throughout his entire brain.  The only options were 1. He would be in a nursing facility for the rest of life in a vegetative state.  Or 2., disconnect the breathing tube, give him plenty of sedation and pain meds so he didn’t feel the tube being taken out, and let him go.         After a call to his older brother Elroy, to find out his wishes, I laid in the hospital bed with my love of 21 years.  My left arm under his neck, my head resting on his chest, and my right arm holding him tightly to me.  I felt his heart stop and I kissed him as his last breath came out.          I desperately need help to bury him.  The funeral home wants $6,000 up front before they come to Mercy Hospital and take him to Cook, MN for embalming, then on to Nett Lake for burial.         I need donations…he has to be buried by noon on Wednesday according to our Ojibwe traditions…and without immediate cash help, I will not be able to make sure he has the proper traditional Ojibwe burial.  He was a Healing Drum carrier.         please, I need help desperately!         Miigwetch - Tank you for anything you can donate.          Jo Lightfeather  ',\n",

The breakdown of the fees is as follows:\\xa0  ▫️truck, tolls, gas, driver ▫️storage ________________  strong $1,900 (Interstate move out costs: RI&gt;MD) /strong   ▫️Hospital\\xa0 ▫️Funeral  ▫️Deposit and administrative fees for prospective, small housing __________________  strong $1,750 (last oustanding fees) /strong    strong Total: $1,900 + $1,750= $3,650 /strong   Over the course of the past 2 months, I have looked for programs in my city that could assist me in this transition, but all are overextended and others disqualify me due to my international status.  So as of the time of writing this post, I have ran out of options, the clock continues ticking and I am in great need of assistance.  My road to recovery from Covid-19 in the midst of personal loss and other challenges, makes me an overcomer. I haven\\'t given up.  I am still full of hope and ready to start life anew!  But the financial challenges that beset me are still with me...And this reality is humbling in its full gravity. If you can help me to rebuild and start a new chapter of life after Covid-19, you will make a key difference in my life.   I will never be able to thank you enough.  But if for whatever reason, you cannot assist me,  strong please forward this campaign to any individuals/organizations in your networks that may be able to help /strong     strong Any donations--of any amount-- and/or referrals will bring me closer to closing the gap and starting a new chapter of life in July 2021. /strong   In advance, I thank you for your consideration and for any assistance/referral you can contribute to my recovery fund!   Because Together We Can Beat the Odds ❤ Not just against Covid-19 and the pandemic, but against anything whatsoever  Warmly in community,  Irene CF  PS: If you have any questions about this campaign--which is the only one I have ever done on my behalf--please feel free to contact me.

       " '  *I have updated this page to help my mom cover expenses that have mounted apart from funeral expenses.*  We Thank you kindly from the bottom of our hearts.\\xa0     Hi guys I made this gofund me account for my Dad he is in Intensive Care Unit fighting for his life because of covid. He\\'s been a hard worker his whole life trying his hardest to provide and for our family to live the american dream. He worked 2 jobs, his favorite job was to sell corn. A lot of Evanston and Chicago residents would always come by to buy his corn but more importantly to socialize with my dad. My dad loves socializing with people! He wanted to continue to sell corn and socialize with his friends even with the pandemic. He wouldn\\'t even care about the amount of corn he would sell daily, he cared more about seeing his daily friends while providing for his family. We ask you guys kindly to donate what you can... anything helps as well as keeping my dad in your prayers. \\xa0     \\xa0       iframe media_type=\"0\" media_id=\"z7H7yCj3OEA\" class=\"youtube-replace\" title=\"YouTube video player\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px;width:560px;height:315px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/z7H7yCj3OEA/?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"1\"  /iframe   ',\n",
       " '   strong English:\\xa0 /strong This is my father-in-law Inocencio Valverde and covid-19 should’ve been his cause of death. However he is a resilient man who fought a good fight and won. Doctors and nurses really didn’t think he was gonna make it. We were told his chances of survival were a single digit number. Death was holding his hand and all we could do was pray. We prayed and it wasn’t that kind of pray where you sit quietly and ask for God to help, it was the kind of pray where you fall to your knees and yell to the lord and cry out in hopes that he gives him another chance at life. I had even called a funeral home to see what their protocol was for taking someone who was positive. By the grace of god, our prayers were heard and my father-in-law was given another chance at life. My husband and I dropped him off at the ER after his 3 day fever wouldn’t break, we left with the intention of being back maybe after two days to pick him up. Within less than an hour of dropping him off at the ER he was admitted into ICU and put on a ventilator. He’s been hospitalized for two months with the majority of his time being spent in ICU. He later made enough progress to be moved to PCU. Yesterday we received good news and he has been accepted for rehab! While he was in ICU the only movement he did was when doctors and nurses would prone him so he became very weak. He’s made a lot of progress and is able to stand with the help of two nurses. With the help of rehab he will one day stand on his own. We now need help to cover some costs and financially help my mother-in-law who has been out of work since Washington’s stay at home order was put in place. Since my father-in-law will need full time care after he is discharged from rehab she won’t be able to go back to work. We are asking that you give us any help you can. Anything helps, even a prayer. Thank you for taking the time to read this. We appreciate any help we get.    strong Spanish:  /strong Este es mi suegro Inocencio Valverde y covid-19 debería haber sido su causa de muerte. Sin embargo, es un hombre fuerte que peleo una buena pelea y gano. Los médicos y las enfermeras realmente no pensaron que lo iba a lograr. Nos dijeron que sus posibilidades de supervivencia eran menos de un 10 por ciento. La muerte estaba sosteniendo su mano y todo lo que podíamos hacer era rezar. Oramos y no fue ese tipo de oración donde te sientas en silencio y le pides ayuda a Dios, fue la clase de oración donde caes de rodillas y le gritas al señor con la esperanza de que él le dé otra oportunidad de vida. Incluso había llamado a una funeraria para ver cuál era su protocolo para llevar a alguien que fuera positivo. Por la gracia de Dios, nuestras oraciones fueron escuchadas y mi suegro tuvo otra oportunidad de vivir. Mi esposo y yo lo dejamos en la sala de emergencias después de que su fiebre de 3 días no se le bajaba, nos fuimos con la intención de regresar quizás después de dos días para recogerlo. En menos de una hora de dejarlo en la sala de emergencias, fue admitido a cuidado intensivo y le pusieron un ventilador. Ha estado hospitalizado durante dos meses y la mayor parte de su tiempo lo pasó en cuidado intensivo. Cuando se recuperó lo suficiente lo movieron a cuidado progresivo. ¡Ayer recibimos buenas noticias y ha sido aceptado para rehabilitación! Mientras estaba en cuidado intensivo el único movimiento que hizo fue cuando los médicos y las enfermeras lo acostaban de pecho y se debilitó mucho. Ha progresado mucho y puede ponerse de pie con la ayuda de dos enfermeras. Con la ayuda de la rehabilitación, esperemos que puedo pararse el solo. Ahora necesitamos ayuda para cubrir algunos gastos y ayudar económicamente a mi suegra, que ha estado sin trabajo desde que el estado de Washington puso la orden de quedarse en casa. Como mi suegro necesitará ayuda de tiempo completo después de que le den de alta de la rehabilitación, no podrá volver a trabajar mi suegra. Le pedimos que nos brinde toda la ayuda que pueda. Cualquier cosa ayuda, incluso una oración. Gracias por tomarse el tiempo de leer esto. Agradecemos cualquier ayuda que recibamos.  ',\n",

       " '  2020 has not been ideal for many however tragedy continues to happen. To recap briefly the beginning for our family it started with the loss of a beloved Uncle, to the tragic accident our cousin was involved in, in an attempt to attend her fathers funeral service.   Our parents, Francisco And Maria Montiel, day after day have been far beyond prime examples of what parents should be. They together and individually have made remarkable role models for all of us children, grandkids, and many others that have come into their lives. They both have worked hard their entire lives to provide for their children which was beyond what is expected for children. Many family members were diagnosed with COVID-19 including our mother and father over the past three months. In July of 2020 our father, Francisco Montiel, was flown to the hospital in Wenatchee, WA where he was admitted to the ICU and placed on a ventilator to help him breathe. Our father battled each day and each minute to beat COVID-19 and it is with a very heavy heart that we share today that he passed away Saturday August 1st, 2020 after an unbelievable fight. The loss, devastation, and pain for our mother is just the beginning of a long battle. Not only is our mother still trying to recover from COVID-19 herself and has been out of work since the beginning of June 2020, there now comes the unforeseen costs for her with our fathers passing. We understand as a family that this time is hard for a lot of individuals and families. If you are able to donate anything at all we truly appreciate it. Many know that the pain is hard enough let alone the cost that comes with celebrating the life of a loved one that has passed. This will also help our mother pay bills, as well as this is not an additional stress we want her to feel during this time. Even if you are unable to donate at this time positive thoughts and prayers are welcome for our family during this very difficult time.   Thank you, Francisco and Maria Montiel’s Children   2020 no ha sido ideal para muchos, aunque la tragedia sigue ocurriendo. Para resumir brevemente el comienzo de nuestra familia comenzó con la pérdida de un querido tío, al trágico accidente que nuestro prima estuvo involucrada, en un accidente al tratar de asistir al funeral de sus padre.  Nuestros padres, Francisco y María Montiel, día tras día han estado mucho más allá de los ejemplos primordiales de lo que deberían ser los padres. Ellos juntos y individualmente han hecho modelos de papel notables para todos nosotros, niños, nietos y muchos otros que han entrado en sus vidas. Ambos han trabajado duro toda su vida para proporcionar a sus hijos que no se esperaba para los niños. Muchos miembros de la familia fueron diagnosticados con COVID-19, incluidos nuestros padres durante los últimos tres meses. En julio de 2020 nuestro padre, Francisco Montiel, fue volado al hospital de Wenatchee, WA donde fue ingresado en la UCI y colocado en un ventilador para ayudarlo a respirar. Nuestro padre luchó cada día y cada minuto para vencer COVID-19 y es con un corazón muy pesado que compartimos hoy que murió el sábado 1 de agosto de 2020 después de una pelea increíble. La pérdida, la devastación y el dolor para nuestra madre es sólo el comienzo de una larga batalla. Nuestra madre no sólo está tratando de recuperarse de COVID-19 y ha estado sin trabajo desde principios de junio de 2020, ahora llega el costo imprevisto para ella con el paso de nuestros padres. Entendemos como familia que esta vez es difícil para muchas personas y familias. Si eres capaz de donar cualquier cosa, realmente lo apreciamos. Muchos saben que el dolor es lo suficientemente duro y mucho menos el costo que viene con celebrar la vida de un ser querido que ha pasado. Esto también ayudará a nuestra madre a pagar facturas, así como este no es un estrés adicional que queremos que ella sienta durante este tiempo. Aunque no sea capaz de donar en este momento pensamientos positivos y oraciones son bienvenidos para nuestra familia durante este momento tan difícil.  Gracias , con cariño y agradecimiento  Los Hijos de Francisco y María Montiel',\n",

Marites is currently in the ICU and has been put on a ventilator as a result of pneumonia due to the after effects of COVID. The Brooks family is experiencing financial strain to cover funeral expenses to put their dad to rest as well as medical expenses for their mother in the hospital.  Bill was born and raised in a small town, Ashgrove, Missouri. When he turned 17, Bill joined the Air Force and served for more than 20 years as a master sergeant. During this time, he married and had two sons, William and Keith. Unfortunately, his first wife passed when the boys were still young. Afterwards, he did civil service for another 20 years during which he married Marites and had son, Matthew, and daughter, Marilette. He later retired at age 65. From this point forward, he made sure to take care of his family. He was always there for his kids and anyone else who he considered family, which was practically everyone he met. Friends and family could count on him when they needed him. He was a loving man and hard worker supporting his family all the way up to his passing.   Marites is currently in the ICU and has been put on a ventilator as a result of pneumonia due to the after effects of COVID. Born in the Philippines, Marites was raised amongst 9 of her siblings, taking care of her younger siblings alongside her elders. When she was only 26 years old, she came to the United States. She met Bill when she was 27 and they married the following year. Another year passed and they had their first child, Matthew, with Marilette following 5 years after. Together, they raised both of their children to be loving, compassionate, and patient. When her mother was older, she took care of her with the help of her older sisters. In 2018, she had open heart surgery as a result of a minor heart attack. In the couple years to follow, she sought comfort from friends and loved ones to help her with the new struggles that came post-surgery. She loves her family very deeply and has been struggling with the loss of her husband while also trying to recover from COVID-19.\\xa0\\xa0  Due to COVID, the Brooks family is experiencing financial strain to cover funeral expenses to put their dad to rest as well as medical expenses for their mother in the hospital.

       " '  We are raising money for my mother, Marty Graves, to help cover medical and memorial costs for my father, Michael Graber, who had emergency brain surgery in February, contracted COVID-19 in March and passed away in April after spending 5 weeks in the ICU fighting for his life. Since we can’t be with my mom physically to help her, this is a way for us to provide some support in this difficult time.     The COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands-to-millions of individuals and families, many tragically. Unfortunately, it has directly impacted my family, too. Shortly after relocating from CA to NYC for work in early March, COVID-19 turned NYC into a pandemic epicenter. As a result, my wife and 1-year old son, who were going to make the trip a few weeks later, had to remain in CA to stay safe. I thought my parents, who in their 70s retired in a small ski town in Colorado, were relatively safe there. It was shocking, a few weeks later, when my mother, Marty, called to tell me my father, Michael (aka Mike), woke up unable to breathe and was on his way to a hospital ICU. We immediately were confronted with the scary reality that both my parents, who are in their 70s, likely have COVID-19.  Marty, a retired elementary school teacher and cancer survivor, thankfully was able to recover from COVID after two weeks of isolation. Mike, was just recovering from brain surgery in February to remove a cancerous brain tumor caused by melanoma, was admitted to the ICU in mid-March, sedated and placed on a ventilator. He tested positive for COVID-19, had two types of pneumonia in his lungs and failing kidneys, but he fought hard. He fought hard enough so that Marty could call him via FaceTime on their 37th\\xa0wedding anniversary on April 2nd, a week after the doctors told her he wasn’t going to make it more than a few days. He continued to fight, but after about 5 weeks in the ICU with ups and downs, he tragically passed away on April 21, 2020. I, my parents only child, was fortunate enough to say goodbye to my father via FaceTime, and my mom was able to be by his side since he was hospitalized long enough for the COVID to pass through his system.  We are trying to raise $30,000 to help with the costs of my father’s recent medical bills incurred, funeral costs and other related costs to alleviate some of the stress on my mother, Marty, as she recovers from this unexpected tragedy and heartache. My father spent about a month in the hospital for the emergency brain surgery and subsequent recovery. We were so excited he was back home and on his way to recovery, when COVID tragically hit my family hard. If you so kindly feel like donating or contributing, we very much appreciate your help and we thank you wholeheartedly.\\xa0  Stay safe, stay healthy and please cherish any time you are able to spend with your loved ones during this time.

As her mother aged there was a need for additional care providers. Unfortunately one of her care providers brought covid into their home.   On October 10th her mom started having breathing issues and was transported to the hospital. The diagnosis was covid. It would be a few days before Kimberly tested positive for covid. October 22nd Kim’s mom died of covid-19 complications. October 24th Kim now very sick and having breathing issues goes to the hospital, in a fight for her life.   This all was happening when Kimberly was preparing knee replacement surgery, in both knees, which she’s needed at age 50 but insurance companies denied. The last 2 years the pain in her knees have forced her to use a riding chair in order to keep mobile, yet she continued to care for her bed-bound mother. Now her body is fighting to recover from covid and knee surgery will be delayed. After 8 days in the hospital Kimberly was sent home but still on oxygen. Pneumonia still taking its toll sent her back to the hospital a second time. Covid has left her with an enlarged pancreas and gall bladder. Her doctors orders were no working for possible months while her body recovers.   If Kim doesn’t work the bills will not get paid. Like most of us she has monthly utilities, car loan, insurance, groceries, medicines and now medical bills plus her mom’s funeral expense.   Your support would be greatly appreciated! Your donations will allow Kimberly the time for her body to recover from covid and regain the strength for knee surgery. This will give her a mobile life again. Kimberly is a very loving, smart and strong individual. Covid has robbed her of not only her best friend, her mother but also Causing her emotional and physical pain plus financial problems. Positive thoughts, prayers and best wishes welcome!  I would be very grateful if you support my niece in her recovery and future life journeys.',\n",

       " 'On April 7, 2021 my sister, Lukie “Kay Kay” Whitfield and her husband, Christopher Whitfield gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Faith. Approximately two weeks after Faith’s birth, Christopher tested positive for COVID-19 on April 20th, and his wife Kay Kay tested positive on April 21st. Shortly after Kay Kay was diagnosed with COVID, she started experiencing a shortness of breath, therefore she went to the hospital on April 23rd to receive medical treatment and was placed on a ventilator on April 26th. While Kay Kay was in the hospital, Christopher remained home and attempted to follow CDC guidelines by quarantining, which required their newborn daughter, Faith and their two year old daughter, Miracle to temporarily reside with his mother-in-law (my mother) to ensure that they were protected and safe from exposure. After attempting to recover from COVID at home alone, sadly, Christopher was found deceased on April 28th when a family member went to check on him after he did not make his routine morning call to check on Faith and Miracle. His wife, Kay Kay was still on the ventilator when Christopher passed away. As the family grieved Christopher’s untimely death, the family held on to faith and prayed for a miracle that Kay Kay would recover prior to her husband’s funeral to pay her final respects and see him one last time (as any spouse would). On Friday, May 14th, family members were in the process of finalizing Christopher’s funeral arrangements at the funeral home, when hospital staff called to inform our family that his wife (my sister) had passed away from COVID. Tragically and sadly, my nieces, Faith and Miracle lost both of their parents to COVID, I lost my sister, and my mother lost her daughter within two weeks (and Faith was only four weeks old at the time of her parents death).   As the world slowly transitions back into the ‘new normal’ since the beginning of the pandemic, our family has been grieving, while of picking-up the pieces of our shattered hearts to adjust to our ‘new normal.’ This tragedy and untimely death of Christopher and Kay Kay resulted in my mother and I becoming the primary caregivers for Faith and Miracle, which requires legal and financial responsibilities with minimal resources due to both parents being deceased. My mother and I love and adore Faith and Miracle dearly, however, I am sure that several of you can relate and understand the lifetime commitment and financial responsibilities that is required when raising children. Due to the young ages of Faith (now 2 months) and Miracle (2 years old), financial assistance is needed to ensure that my mother and I can provide them with stability ranging from baby items, clothes, childcare, etc. In the midst of everything occurring in the world, my mother and I sincerely appreciate you taking out the time to read about our life-changing reality. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and if you are unable to contribute, keeping Faith, Miracle, and our family in your thoughts and prayers is also greatly appreciated.',\n",
       " 'Richard and Joyce Tockey were diagnosed with COVID-19 on December 28th, 2020, and their daughter, Denise Wilkerson, was diagnosed the following day. The Tockeys were both later hospitalized, diagnosed with Pneumonia and were in AFib. Joyce was able to come home, but later had to return to the hospital due to a collapsed lung. Joyce was in the COVID ICU for a combined 14 days. During this time, Richard was put on a ventilator. Shortly after, his kidneys started to shut down and he passed away on January 14th, 2021. Joyce was only able to say goodbye to him over FaceTime from the ICU. Joyce is home now, but still recovering from COVID, needing 24/7 assistance as she has lost almost all of her ability to sit up, stand, or walk on her own. Denise is home and recovering as well. Richard was the main source of income for his family of 4. With the loss of his income and the addition of funeral, medical expenses, and further medical services needed to recover from COVID, the Tockey/Wilkerson family is in a deep financial and emotional struggle. Their granddaughter, Kayla and daughter-in-law, Teresa, have been working to take care of Joyce and Denise while they recover from COVID. Kayla has not been able to work her typical hours, along with the loss of Denise and Joyce’s incomes, this has caused a lot of strain. Alongside the emotional toll this family has already endured, they are now trying to find a way to financially move forward. They are in a position where they are having to sell their home, trying to find a way to pay for their Mother/Grandmother’s medical expenses, Father/Grandfather’s funeral expenses, and further medical care, bills, and basic living needs. If you are able to donate to the Tockey/Wilkerson COVID Relief Fund, your donations would immensely help this family pay Joyce’s medical bills, paying Richard’s funeral expenses, and selling their house and relocating to a more affordable home. Thoughts and prayers for this family are greatly appreciated.',\n",

I am starting this fundraiser to help Beth Yarbrough and her step-daughter, Christine, to raise money for funeral costs of Beth's husband of 33 years,  Donnie Yarbrough.  Beth is absolutely devastated as this is quite unexpected.  Donnie was a kidney transplant recipient, who recently contracted Covid 19.  Donnie was very weak at home with Covid 19 and suffered a fall that caused  him to suffer internal brain injuries.

I lost my grandfather (one of the key people who raised me), I battled a painful case of Covid-19 (I could not eat for a month) and I watched 3 year's worth of savings dwindle in funeral and medical costs...  With no medical insurance coverage due to my international status and no immediate family to assist me, my personal finances took a major hit.

       " '  Hi, my name is Brady. I set up this relief fund for a family that is very close to me. They have had a very tough and emotional month as their father, Rick (59) and brother, Dallin (31) were in the ICU due to complications from Covid-19. They both spent over three weeks in the hospital fighting a hard and long battle.         Here is a little bit of each of their stories and who you will be helping with each donation:          strong  Rick’s Story: /strong    img alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/58855983_1627927859748832_r.\"   /        On July 8th, 2021 Rick went into the Intensive Care Unit to fight Covid-19/Pnuemonia. He fought long and hard to do everything in his power to recover. His journey was a rollercoaster of trying every measure and every path the doctors could take to help his body recover. After fighting for 21 days in the ICU, he lost his life due to complications from the virus. He was a young 59 year old beloved husband, father, and grandfather, who brightens each room, and was known to be a gentle giant standing at 6’6” feet tall. He was dearly loved and will be missed by his wife, 5 kids and 8 grandkids. He loved his family, sports, motorcycles, and playing lawn games.         We are hoping to provide financial relief to his wife, Joyce, of 37 years for loss of income, funeral costs, and medical bills that will come from his fight in the ICU and his passing. We would love to help take some of this load off of her so she can focus on what’s important, which is grieving her beloved husband and caring for her son.          strong  Dallin’s Story: /strong    img alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/58855983_1627927430630905_r.\"   /        On July 10th, 2021 Dallin went into the Intensive Care Unit to also start his fight against Covid-19, Pneumonia, and Staph infection. He and his dad Rick were just a few rooms away in the ICU as they fought this illness. Dallin fought hard and also had a very rollercoaster like experience with his journey in the ICU as Covid is unpredictable and is very unforgiving to the lungs. He almost lost his life on day 7, but through a miracle and through all the prayers, his body started to respond to the treatment and he continued on the road to recovery. He was able to come home to continue to recover by the grace of a loving God. He is at a family member’s home recovering from 17 days in the ICU. The recovery is going to be long and hard for Dallin. He has to retrain his body to do the simplest things again.         We are hoping to help him with loss of income as he can’t work for another 1-2 months, and the extensive medical bills that will come from being in the ICU. We know Dallin’s journey of recovery was a miracle and we want to share that with you in the following updates.         Any contribution will be greatly appreciated.

       " 'Covid-19 Relief for Patricia L. DeRusha  September 24, 1960 – April 29th 2020  Patty gained her angel wings after a long, hard fight with the Covid-19 virus on April 29th, at 8:15pm with her loving daughter by her side.  On April 7th, Patty started showing signs of Covid-19. The Sanctuary in West St. Paul, an assisted living facility tested Patty for Covid-19. On April 9th, Patty was sent by ambulance to United Hospital as her symptoms continued to worsen. After being at the hospital overnight, The Sanctuary called the hospital to inform hospital staff of positive Covid-19 tests results.  Patty moved into The Sanctuary assisted living facility in early January 2020 to receive assistance with her everyday needs. Patty’s daughter Mary visited her in January and due to Mary’s emergency medical needs and the visitor restrictions at The Sanctuary, did not get to see her again until April 29, 2020.  The Sanctuary stopped allowing visitors on March 16th and the MN shelter in place went into effect shortly after on March 27th. Mary would call the facility daily to check on Patty due to Patty not having a working phone. She was reassured each day that Patty was healthy and safe.  On the morning of April 10th, Mary received a phone call from Patty’s case manager informing her that Patty was at United with a confirmed positive Covid-19 test result. Mary was instantly overwhelmed with emotions and the need for answers.  While in the hospital, Mary was able to speak with Patty with the help of nurses. Patty was very confused and didn’t understand why she was in the hospital. Due to Patty’s underlying health conditions, her condition progressed quickly. Patty was on o2 while struggling to breath, had a fever and a reported crackle in her lungs. On April 11th, Patty was transferred to the ICU unit and placed on a ventilator. On April 14th, Patty was placed on full life support and in a medically induced coma. On April 15th the doctors started to be concerned of Patty’s kidney function. April 17th, ICU doctors contemplated if being on life support was helping or making her condition worse, while Patty’s BP dropped to dangerously low levels. Patty suffered from kidney damage, needing insulin, low blood pressure, increased damage to her lungs and blood clots due to Covid-19.  While trying to bring Patty out of the medically induced coma, they would place the phone to her ear for Mary and Patty’s brother Rob to speak to her, praying for a response. Mary continue to ask family and friends for prayers.  On April 29th, Mary received a call from a concerned ICU doctor. After begging and pleading, Mary was finally allowed to be by her mother’s side as they placed Patty on comfort care. Patty’s brother Rob, her grandchildren Cody, Hailey and Devan, her best friend Tammy and Mary’s fiancé all got to say their goodbyes by phone.  Patty is from the West Side of St. Paul and graduated from Humboldt High School in 1978. She was a proud mother and grandmother. Anyone that ever-met Patty, instantly loved her. Patty always had a smile on her face, she cared deeply and was always supportive. Patty loved spending time with friends and family and enjoyed her casino time.  Funeral services will take place at Summit Funeral and Cremation in Inver Grove Heights. She was loved by so many and Mary has decided to post pone services until everyone can celebrate Patty’s life together.\\xa0  Please consider donating to help cover Patty’s funeral costs, no amount is too small.  Thank you all for the love and support and As Mary would say, “Rest in Paradise Mama.”',\n",

       " 'The COVID-19 Pandemic has deeply affected my paternal family in Perú (all those affected pictured above). About two weeks ago, my aunt Lily and her immediate family all tested positive. Since then, their symptoms have worsened: my aunt and her son are currently in the hospital and her husband Orlando (far right) sadly just passed away today. She and my uncle Hernán alternate in taking care of my grandma at her home; thus, soon after she and her family tested positive, so did my abuelita and him.   Since then, they too have gotten worse. My uncle Hernán (far left) is currently in the ICU in Lima, while my grandma is on constant oxygen, being taken care of at home 24/7 by two hired nurses and an EM technician. Unfortunately, given the state of COVID-19 in Perú, there are little to no beds available; many older individuals like my abuelita are not prioritized in the allotment of hospital beds. Therefore, she will continue to need full-time care in her home.   Needless to say, the last two weeks have been emotionally draining on our family. Now with my uncle Orlando’s passing, it’s clear that finances are becoming an additional stress as well.\\xa0  We are asking you all to consider helping our family with the expenses stacking up at the moment (hospital stay, oxygen/medical supplies, hired nursing staff, funeral expenses, etc). If there is anything you all can donate, no matter how much, it would be greatly appreciated. Being far away, our family here in the US feels powerless.

As much as Minda wanted to stay with us and fought so hard to do so, her body could no longer fight.  Minda was a wonderful wife to her husband Silverio “Boyong” for 39 years, a proud and loving mother to three children: Paul, Chiara “Cha Cha”\\xa0(†)\\xa0and Jennifer, sister to six siblings and friend to many. Minda meaningfully touched the lives of those around her. She had a vibrant spirit that could light up a room, and she went out of her way to support those she loved. Minda treated everyone like family, making sure you were always comfortable (and always had something to eat). I think everyone who was lucky enough to know her shared the same feelings of love, devotion, and admiration toward her. We are all devastated by Minda’s passing.  Many have asked how they can help the family in this difficult time. Your prayers and support have been so important along the way of this horrific journey. In lieu of flowers, a financial gift to aid in the hospital expenses and Minda’s final resting place would be a great help to the Baranda family, who has been through so much. Minda will be buried in Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, NJ, just a short distance from her daughter Chiara.  Details of visitation and funeral arrangements will be shared shortly. For those who wish to participate but are unable to attend in person, a live stream via Zoom will be available.  For those who do not know me, my name is Skylar and I am Paul’s girlfriend. I am so grateful to have gotten to know Minda over the past five years, but I am heartbroken to have not had more time with her. The family does not typically ask for help, but I want Minda to know I will take care of her son, as well as Jennifer and Boyong, for the rest of my life.  I have asked Nikki Nueva to help coordinate this. Nikki was like another daughter to Minda. The Llamas &amp; Nueva families have always been close to the Barandas, and they are always the first to show up when you need support.',\n",

       " 'Balbino Torres, 85 years old, currently working as an active nurse, has just lost the love of his life, Iris Torres of 72 years of age. They’ve been married over 35 years. Prior to meeting Iris, Balbino was a priest and retired in order to marry Iris and become the greatest step-father four girls could ever ask for. He still wanted to serve the Lord and help people so he went to school and became a nurse for over 30 years. It is his passion being able to help the weak. He has been a faithful husband and a faithful caretaker of the elderly. His wife Iris has had asthma and pulmonary disease for several years. In March she was admitted to the hospital for difficulty breathing. They treated her as if asthma but did a Covid-19 test on her. Before results returned, Iris was put on a ventilator in the middle of the night. Not able to speak with Balbino nor her daughters again. The results later came back positive for Covid-19, and the doctors now knew how to treat her.   After three weeks on the ventilator, under heavy sedation and roller coaster emotions of her health status, the family finally saw light at the end of the tunnel with doctors news. Iris had fought a good fight and was breathing 60% with the ventilator working at 40%. She was taken off sedation and was responding to nurses for two days, nodding yes/no answers to nurses and smiling at photos of her family that her daughters provided on a poster. For sure she was going to come off the ventilator within a few days and doctors update was that she should be healing and going home soon. One evening, the night nurse saw Iris was needing oxygen. Shortly after the lungs were shocked and Iris went into cardiac arrest that night but was resuscitated. The next morning the daughters and Balbino heard the update of the horrific evening their mother had. Their joy and excitement had turned into sorrow and heartache. The rest of the week was filled with many calls to doctors to try to save Iris life. On April 25th, after 38 days of fighting for her life and not being able to see her husband nor daughters again, Iris passed away.   Iris was a wonderful woman that had a heart of gold and full of life. She is survived by her husband Balbino and her 4 daughters of which had just unexpectedly buried their biological father last month on March 17th. Iris was known by all as a great friend and the best cook ever. Growing up, her daughters witnessed their mother and Balbino help the needy by bringing food to them and at times taking them to shop for food. They also helped others by creating small home projects so they can work for money with dignity. The couple always reminded the four girls to have an open heart for the needy as they were Gods children also. Regardless of how little Balbino and Iris had to offer, they still helped. They not only raised the girls going to church but they also showed them how to be the church with action. One of the last conversations Iris had with her daughters was not to waste money on funeral flowers, “flowers are for the living” she said. “Instead, remember to feed the hungry and help the needy”.  Balbino has not only been left with a huge empty hole in his heart but also much debt and funeral expenses. There is a remaining balance for the funeral of approximately $10,000, prior medical bills,\\xa0 mortgage payments and housing expenses. With the great sadness at the age of 85, loneliness and still working as a nurse, his daughters fear for his health.\\xa0 Any donation, big or small, helps. His daughters ask with great humility.  All funds will be given directly to Balbino Torres for funeral costs, credit card debt and living expenses in hopes to fill him with hope and strength to live on during this painful and life altering season.',\n",
       " 'Dear Friends and Family:  I am reaching out to you on behalf of my family in Paraguay who are battling Covid. My uncle Tony who is the head of the family, my cousin Noemi who is 29, my nephew Tobias who is just 16 and my beloved grandmother are all infected with the virus, they are in critical health condition and are deteriorating rapidly. Sadly my uncle Narciso passed away today from the virus. Unfortunately public hospitals in Paraguay are all at full capacity and are not accepting more patients. Along with this the prices of medicine have increased due to the pandemic, making it extremely hard to find oxygen, or just to access a place to keep them isolated to prevent the virus from further spreading among our family and others. I am using this platform to ask for your help since we are out of the funds needed to keep fighting this dreadful virus, including the cost of funerals and other expenses. If you would like to assist with our financial crisis, any donation that comes from your heart will be greatly appreciated. May the Lord bless you all.',\n",

Our goal now is to try to get Mia home to us so we can see her one last time. All current and future funds will be going toward transporting her home to Ohio and her funeral service. Any support, even just sharing the link below, means the world to our family.      _____________________________________________         Mia Balazowich, age 51, mother of 4 children and grandmother to 4 grandchildren, is currently in a medically induced coma fighting for her life after the harsh effects of Covid-19. While visiting her youngest son, who had recently returned from serving his country in the United States Marine Corps, and her new grandson, Mia tested positive for Covid-19 and fell ill shortly after.                  Her body has been through different medications, and a medically induced coma on ventilator life support all in just the short span of a couple of weeks. While Mia is fighting for her life in the hospital, her kids are fighting to keep her world from crumbling once she recovers. Mia unfortunately does not have medical insurance, and with all the care she’s being given in the hospital, the bills are rapidly stacking up. Additionally, there is no way to maintain her separate financial responsibilities such as her mortgage, utilities, etc. and she’ll soon be at risk to losing her home.                  We have asked for thoughts and prayers, and now we’re asking for any relief you can provide toward all the bills. Her family wants to spend their time helping Mia recover physically without also having to worry of how they’ll help her recover financially.  Mia is the most kind-hearted, selfless woman in the world and needs all the help she can get. Please help us bring our Mimi home.                 img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61846131_1639096627901789_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61846131_1639099991327455_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61846131_1639096460228622_r.\"   /          img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61846131_1639100222904308_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61846131_1639100603336688_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61846131_1639100416175385_r.\"   /                                     ',\n",

       " '  i am trying to gather funds for my moms funeral and creamation.     \\xa0     Miss Janet Burnsed was born 3/30/1949 in Jacksonville fl. When she was 18 months she got polio. They never expected her to walk again but she did. She never allowed herself to be weak. Over the years she ended up with congestive heart failure and copd. On august 30th 2021 she was complaining of being unable to breath. She was taken to the hospital via ambulance. She was told her heart was failing but they were able to get it under control and they suggested she go into a rehab to learn to walk again. She agreed because she’d been struggling for a long time and it’s the only thing she wanted was to be able to have more mobility. Sept 7 she was sent to a place to which was the start of a major decline. The facility did not help her instead they dropped her not once but twice. They left her on the floor for 2 hours the first time. Denied her a X-ray on her leg as she was in a a lot of pain. I her daughter had to demand them check her leg and after days if fighting them they finally did and got her some pain relief. She was starting to do well again however they were denying her water and on oct 1 i got a call that she was dehydrated and they would do iv fluids and she’d be better. I called oct 2nd asking how she was ans if she was up to having visitors snd i was told yes she was fine. I made her some food as i had been doing and we went to see her. What i found was her laying in bed blue and barely alive. Her bed was cutting her oxygen off and i knew something was off and not right., i sat with her for a while and she couldn’t stay awake. I asked the nurse if she felt that was normal she said oh ya she’s just dehydrated.. i got home and it wasn’t sitting right with me so i called and asked questions.. the answer i got was she’s fine however i told them no she is not fine i think she needs a hospital.. they argued with me and did not want to get her to a hospital but eventually went and talked to her and she said yes she wants to go to hospital… they told me they’re not going to send her by emergency but would get an ambulance. The hospital called me that night asking some questions and told me her kidneys were failing and it was a emergency to start dialysis. I said do whatever you need! So they did. She was out of it the whole time and fought them. But they got it done. We didn’t know if she’d wake up… about two days later i got a call and it was her. That was so joyous! She was in the hospital for about two weeks then was sent to another rehab we had high hopes that this would be good. It was not. She was to weak to do what they needed but we didn’t know at the time her carbon monoxide was building up and causing her to be shaking. At some point they told me her potassium was low and they felt it was because she’d not been eating. She hated their food but it was honestly disgusting. On November 11th we got a call that she was in respiratory failure and we should let nature takes its course. We demanded they get her on a ambulance to a hospital. The hospital doctors called me almost right away saying get your family together she’s very bad off. A doctor tried to save her by discovering a bipap would pull the bad off her body and help… she didn’t want it but she tried… she was able to survive this. She started to bounce back but her kidneys started to fail again. At this point the hospital Decided she’s in need of hospice care. She was not ready she told them she wanted to keep trying to fight but deep down knew her body was overwhelmed and overworked.. we got covid which stole 3 weeks visiting with her and each day i started to see a decline in her health she was able to come home on home hospice dec 16 and went downhill basically the moment she got in my house… she rallied for about a hour Sunday which was gods gift of our last breakfast together we had eggs sausage and some milk.. with ina hour she started to get terminal agitation that lasted till Sunday night when we got her comfortable with medication and she peacefully passed Tuesday December 21,2021 at 5:00 am right in the dot.

But even with his success and the challenges he would occasionally face, he never forgot about his family in Panama. Nearly every year, he would take vacation to spend time with them, go on trips with them, and to simply spend time with them, having conversations well into the night. And more often than not, he took me with him. To him, family was everything.     \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/60106723_1632251106604410_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     He liked basketball, and played it well.

And while he certainly wasn\\'t perfect, he was smart, handsome, quick-witted, thoughtful, and fun. And with every photograph I look at of him, I realize more and more just why people gravitated to him. In nearly every photo of him, he was always smiling, always having a good time. Everyone always told me how unique it was that I was so close to him because we got along like friends. But it wasn\\'t strange to me. Not when I knew he loved me unconditionally and always did his best to impart onto me that we were a team---the only two from my dad\\'s family who chose to build a life in America.\\xa0     \\xa0     With his painful passing, I am now forced to deal with a tough and unwanted reality because for the first time, I am alone when he didn\\'t mean to leave me. And this was something my dad, who had prided himself on being healthy and strong, didn\\'t foresee. Now, I\\'m living in a two-bedroom apartment that I now have to sustain as a college student who doesn\\'t have a job because she\\'d made a deal with her amazing dad who wanted to support her so that she could finish college quickly.\\xa0  Where the funeral is concerned, I want to fulfill his longstanding wish to be buried next to his mother and sister in Colinas de La Paz, in Arraijan, Panama.

Although my parents divorced years ago, my mom wants to help me so bad, but she is disabled and currently recovering and doing rehabilitation that resulted from a third stroke that impacted her in May 2021.

And so, now, I am alone, I am scared, I am worried, endure sleepless nights, and am wondering how the next few months are going to go when I can\\'t work until I come back (hopefully) from Panama after burying him. Due to the high levels of funeral services needed during this peak Covid-19 Delta variant cycle here in South Florida, the processing of his death certificate will take longer than normal (2 weeks), which keeps my hands tied for the rest of September.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/60106723_1632286991965743_r.jpeg\" alt=\"60106723_1632286991965743_r.jpeg\"     /   As his only descendant, all of the decisions concerning him are up to me, and yet I still also have to worry about what will become of me in trying to hold down the fort over the next few months until I can get a job.

It would be  strong such  /strong a blessing to not have to worry about further financial instability, as the base price of just the burial and service alone at Colinas de La Paz is roughly $2,000+. But every cent counts and no amount is too small. I know that this is a terrible and scary era that we are living in. And many people are in trouble. But I do believe in humanity and the human spirit and I hope that anyone is generous enough to help.\\xa0  To be completely transparent, I do need the funds as soon as possible as I\\'m attempting to go to Panama after the 6th of October to bury my dad, if by some miracle this all works out. And whatever funds are left will go to paying utilities, rent, groceries, medical bills, medical and car insurance, my dad\\'s car loan, and other related expenses for the next few months until I can get back on my feet.

       " \"   John passed away on November 22. \\xa0    Now that the funeral is over, the medical bill are going to start piling up.\\xa0                   Update 11/9  This whole journey has been full of ups and downs, good days and bad days, and anxiety and relief!! Today, as our families gathered to listen to Johns doctor we got a glimmer of hope. There is a last resort option called the ECMO machine. It is a life support machine that oxygenates the body and bypasses the lungs and the heart so that they can rest. This would be in preparation for a lung transplant and it is our last resort to save John! He must meet some criteria and be accepted to one of the very few hospitals that offer this! We hope that this is the miracle we have been waiting for! We will know within the next few days if he has been accepted and where he will be transferred to. Pray hard for a miracle!! We all need John here!!   Update 11/8  I know that everyone has been waiting for an update on John. I have a million messages that I haven't even opened. Our families have needed time to process the information that the doctor told us so thank you for being patient. Johns CT scan showed that his lungs have gotten worse. They have become stiffer, so it's harder for the oxygen to get inside of them. He now has congestive heart failure and his organs are starting to shut down. He is being kept alive on the ventilator and hasn't been able to tolerate less oxygen. The doctor told us that his lungs will never heal enough for him to breathe on his own.

       " 'Our dear family member,  strong Julia Guanga /strong , unexpectedly passed away in the hospital earlier this week due to complications from Covid-19. She was only 59 years old. Julia was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, friend, and co-worker. Our family in America, as well as in Ecuador and beyond, is devastated as we struggle to understand why she was taken from us so abruptly. Before she passed, Julia spent two months in the hospital and her family is now left with many medical bills. They are making arrangements for Julia’s funeral and expenses have quickly piled up. As friends of the Morocho family, we have created this campaign in an effort to help Julia’s husband, Luis, cover some of the many expenses that they are currently faced with.  Julia emigrated to the United States in 1996 to give her children a better future. When she first came to work in New York, she had to leave her children, Christian, Veronica, and Joanna behind in Ecuador. This caused her and her husband, Luis, great sadness. Eventually, they were able to reunify the family. Thanks to the grace of God, she was again with her children and this brought her great happiness. Julia was a very hard working person. She worked three jobs and as a result her health suffered. She struggled and recovered, but not everything was complete. As an undocumented immigrant, she had to do whatever work was available and, of course, with little salary and was discriminated against by her employers, like every person exploited by not having papers. In 2019, she applied to change her status by petition of her son, a US citizen, to become a Permanent Resident (Green Card holder). Julia\\'s immigration journey was complicated as laws kept changing, however in June 2020, she became a Permanent Resident. With the security of Permanent Residency, Julia was able to make another dream come true: to visit her country, Ecuador, in October 2020. Julia loved being able to see her mother again, although her father had already passed away without being able to say goodbye when he could not travel. Sadly, Julia became infected with COVID a few days before returning to the United States and had to change plans. Though she became ill, she was able to recover with the strength of God. Upon returning to the United States Julia\\'s health declined. She experienced shortness of breath and went to the emergency room in December 2020. She fought bravely until February 1, 2021, when she turned off her light and left this earth. Her husband, Luis, is now left with a mountain of medical debts. Julia\\'s children and family will never forget her.\\xa0   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612389479986160_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612389479986160_r.jpeg\" /   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612386723480435_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612386723480435_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612386761506057_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612386761506057_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612387011657788_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612387011657788_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612387051290745_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612387051290745_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612387522622576_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612387522622576_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612387537462571_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612387537462571_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612387579219885_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612387579219885_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612387596430806_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612387596430806_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612391568283117_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612391568283117_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612389527282873_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612389527282873_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612390702957122_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612390702957122_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612390981334029_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612390981334029_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612391006618393_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612391006618393_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_161239125476490_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_161239125476490_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/54380800_1612393754477391_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"54380800_1612393754477391_r.jpeg\" / ',\n",
       " '     Hi my name is Marlaina &amp; this has been the hardest thing I’ve ever went through, and has been so difficult having to ask for help. I’m looking to help me and my family pay for my dads medical bills and funeral costs.               My dad has been such a huge part of mine and my daughters life. And is an amazing person inside and out. He could make anyone laugh, everyone was drawn to him. He was the type of person where you couldn’t be mad at him long.               My family and I suffered from Covid in late September. After everyone else was getting better my dad took a turn for the worst. He was immediately sent up to ICU with his oxygen being at 72%. He was diagnosed with Covid Pneumonia. He’s been in the hospital ever since. His oxygen was staying between 88-92 on 100% oxygen and the use of a C-PAP machine. We all had so much hope. Until they allowed me and my family into the Covid Ward in the hospital. That’s when you know it’s bad. We got to see his X-Rays of his lungs. And 3/4 of his lungs were white from scarring &amp; inflammation. We are all so blessed we got to see him awake when we did. My fathers health critically spiraled on October 11th at 3:30AM his oxygen level went to 70% (Meanwhile he is on 100% oxygen at all times) and he was turning blue. They asked him if he wanted to be put on the ventilator. He reluctantly said yes. Now all of his organs are failing. His extremities are turning blue. My father will never live a normal life again. His kidneys are failing him. His heartbeat has gone to 30 bpm. And even if they do amputate my dad‘s legs and put him on dialysis there is still no saying he will get better and he would be on a feeding tube and Trach for the rest of his life. So instead of having my dad suffer just out of selfishness we are now just in a waiting game. My father was always terrified of drowning, because that’s how his brother died. So instead of just unplugging the ventilator we are going to wait until his heart stops and not resuscitate so my father could go peacefully and quickly.               I know this is a hard time for everyone, but without my dad here my family is going to lose everything. So all I can do is try. If you can’t give which I will completely understand sharing is enough. Any dollar and share is a help. My family really needs help, and I don’t want my father to worry about us in the afterlife. He deserves a viewing, And me and my family really need help with the medical costs because insurance does not cover all of it. I mean really this man deserves the world, but if we could just give him a proper goodbye, and if we could get at least some of his medical bills covered it would mean the world to us. We are going to loose where we live so if we could get even the tiniest relief it’s something. If you’ve taken the time to read this long thank you so much. God bless and hold your family tight. Thank you everyone.     ',\n",

Rewind just a month ago, they had tons of plans but planning for a funeral was \\xa0certainly not one of them.\\xa0  Please, I beg… help lessen this anguish.\\xa0  We love you Tom    One of my best friends Andrea and her husband could really use help. Her and her husband both came down with COVID. She pulled through with just bad memories of it but her husband Tom has not been as fortunate.\\xa0  Tom is currently fighting for his life, literally hanging by a thread. He has been suffering in the hospital since October 23rd, he’s now on a ventilator with an unknown future.\\xa0  While praying can help with healing powers it can’t help financially. Tom has obviously lost income while being hospitalized and will lose even more income god willing he recovers. Andrea has also lost income as she has not left his side. Just imagine losing a few months of income… most of us would be financially devastated.\\xa0  Andrea is the type of person that helps everyone yet would never dream of asking for help herself so here I am pleading on her behalf. Tom is a prideful man, he would never dream of asking for help either. He would give the shirt off his back to anyone who was cold yet stand shivering before he’d ever asked for someone to help warm him.\\xa0  In short I am desperate to find them some type of financial relief.\\xa0  Please help Tom and Andrea, the last thing they need is to worry about how they will make their mortgage payments let alone put food on their table once this mess is over.\\xa0  If you are unable to donate please share this and please pray! Toms wife needs him, his children need him and his grandchildren need him… please pray for his recovery.\\xa0 /font ',\n",

Right now, my beloved sister Rocio Valdivieso Flores is in critical condition with COVID-19 in Lima, Peru. We need to urgently raise funds for her to be admitted to either a hospital or a clinic, whichever has an available bed for her. Hospital beds are very scarce, clinics are cost-prohibitive, and we are struggling to find more oxygen to keep her breathing at my family's home. She must be medically treated immediately in order to survive the virus.  Other members of the household have contracted the virus too and we need to prepare for the worst. We don’t want to lose another member of our family to COVID-19. Our family appreciates any contribution you are able to make. If you are not able to send money, please share this message with your friends and colleagues. These have been the hardest, most uncertain days we have had to endure.\\xa0 Our deepest gratitude, the Valdivieso Flores family.

       " 'About a month ago, our dear friend Allison’s father went into Brookhaven/LIC Hospital for a bad case of pneumonia. While in the hospital,  strong Steven Brown /strong \\xa0unfortunately contracted COVID-19, on top of the already increasing complications with his lungs. After a few weeks in the hospital and a stint on a ventilator, the doctors decided that Steve’s body was strong enough to be able to come off the vent. Shortly after being taken off of it and taken out of the ICU, Steve had an unexpected heart attack that wound up taking his life. Up until that moment, this family received nothing but good news and positive updates from the doctors and nurses at the hospital, who were also working tirelessly to care for not only Steve, but all of the other COVID patients. To get such positive news and hear that your father or husband was doing so well, and then to be hit with the blow he passed away from something completely unrelated to what he was being treated for, is just beyond any words that I can begin to describe. Our hearts hurt for our friend and her family, and we want to help in any way that we can. Money doesn’t help heal the pain of losing a loved one, but it does give some relief to any sort of financial hardship that may come with both medical and funeral expenses, along with any other bills and every day living expenses. We know that this is a tough time for everyone right now, but we are\\xa0asking that if you have anything to give so that we can help this family get some peace of mind and try to grieve the loss of their father and husband, we would be more than grateful. And if you are unable to donate, please just pray for and send nothing but positivity and love to this family. They didn’t deserve this, and we hope that we can help them even if it’s just a small amount. Thank you much in advance for reading this, and please stay safe and healthy during these trying times. All of our families and friends need us.',\n",
       " 'Towards the end of March 2020, Jesus \"Jay\" Wong started to experience symptoms he never felt before. On his birthday, April 2nd, he was taken to the hospital due to severe breathing issues. He tested positive for Covid-19, treated for symptoms of pneumonia and was placed on a ventilator. Shortly after midnight on April 24th, he lost his life due to complications from the infection. This hard working man fought very hard and so long to get a chance to see his friends and family again.   He was a loving grandfather, husband, father, uncle, brother, and son. His life was to serve and provide for the well-being of others. He birthed and nurtured a restaurant in the heart of New York for over 30 years. He loved and was passionate to serve the community, cook his favorite ingredients, and drive around town only to share warm experiences. Towards the end of his career, his wife was diagnosed with mental illnesses and dedicated the remainder of his life taking care of her.  He leaves behind 3 grandchildren, 2 daughters, son, 2 brothers and his mother of 88 years. It was a shock to his community for such a sweet, humble, and innocent soul to be taken away. Everyone who got the chance to be around him during his life will never forget his compassionate warm spirit.  These funds will used for the burial and memorial for our family during these harsh economic times. The funeral will be on May 20th when funds will be expected. He will be laid to rest near his father.   In these dark, sad and troubling times, we understand many are going through similar hardships. We are thankful for any support that can be provided to the Wong and Santana families for his funeral.',\n",

He was put on a ventilator, and unfortunately did not make it through. He was the most selfless, head strong and caring friend I have ever met, and became one of the closest friend to many others. He lived with his mom (a single immigrant parent) and his older sister. He helped them with money the most he could, he loved them with his whole heart- as he loved anyone in his life.

Since she went into the hospital she has had many ups and downs but recently (on 9/24) was placed on the vent due to her oxygen levels not staying high enough.               Unfortunately the bills and general expenses (e.g., groceries, meals, utilities) are starting to pile up as both of my parents are unable to work. So, even though Lawrence (Diannas husband) has not asked for help, I know that any relief in this regard will help him and our family at this time. It sounds like mom will likely be in the hospital for a while, so we would really appreciate any and all support that can be provided at this time.               Mom is absolutely the light of this family, one of the most positive and strong people that we know. We are trying to stay as positive as we can during this time and appreciate all of the love and support from our friends and family during this time!  ',\n",
       " \"For those of you who had a chance to meet and know our Mom, Alvira Weyers lived for her kids and her family above herself. She dedicated her life to taking care of her first husband and her children, and then her second husband Jerry, her\\xa0 children, and her grandchildren.\\xa0  Over the last few months, it was our turn to take care of our Mom. In November, Mom had an infection complicated by diabetes that resulted in the amputation of her leg. She was in high spirits throughout her recovery, although the odds were stacked against her. After transitioning to a rehab facility, contracting COVID-19, and working through physical therapy, we were so excited to bring her home on December 1.  Following a week and a half of tumultuous care for Mom as we struggled to understand her lack of appetite, her decreasing energy, and her lethargy, I called 911 to try and figure out what was going on with our Mom. After a quick vitals check, the EMTs insisted that Mom had to go into the hospital again on December 13. Her BP and blood sugar had both dropped dangerously low, and if she didn't go in that day, she likely would have passed in her sleep that night.\\xa0  For the last several days in the hospital, Mom seemed to operate on a yo-yo -- she would do well for a few days, able to talk to us on the phone and complain about the food, the TV, and generally feeling grumpy about being in the hospital again (who can blame her?). But as time went on, we were informed by doctors of the dire straights our Mom was in.  Septic shock had set in as a result of an infection gone unnoticed and untreated during her time in the hospital and rehab facilities, badly damaging a majority of her organs and leading to an inability for her body to maintain its own blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. In addition, she tested positive again for COVID-19, resulting in us not being able to see or visit her due to the restrictions in place for the hospital.   Following the good days, she had increasing bad ones; incoherence, delirium and hallucinations, and pain. At the time, the doctors all seemed optimistic to some degree. While Mom was doing poorly, she still showed her fighting spirit, and we were told that we might have weeks or months with our Mom still before she ultimately succumbed to her illness.  On December 25, we were told to come in and see our Mom, as it might be the last chance we had. We also had to make the difficult decision on whether we would transition her to comfort care, or continue aggressive measures that were causing our Mom more suffering than relief. We moved her to comfort care, and they comforted us by saying that we would likely have a few days, at least, before our Mom passed.  Two hours after leaving the hospital on Christmas, my sister Alicia received the call that she had passed, in her sleep, peacefully and in no pain thanks to the measures of comfort care providing her with some pain relief.\\xa0  Where we thought we had months to save and plan for a funeral arrangement and support for her youngest daughter, Shaunna, we now had hours.\\xa0  This GoFundMe is set up to help support costs relating to our mother's cremation, and to help support her youngest daughter, Shaunna, in Kim's care. While dealing with the various diagnoses that had set in, our Mom had fallen behind on both her mortgage and a number of other bills, putting the house Kim and Shaunna live in in jeopardy of foreclosure.\\xa0  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Any donations that do not go directly to the cremation and memorial costs, or to paying off the owed mortgage and utility bills, will be placed into a savings account for Shaunna for any emergency necessities and a future college fund.\\xa0  Thank you so, so much for any help, donations, or sharing you provide.\",\n",

       " 'During these unprecedented times, our family has been immensely affected by COVID-19. Our entire family were symptomatic after being infected and tested positive for the virus. Our mom was hospitalized and strongly battled the virus. Unfortunately on January 3rd, Mey Kouei Saechao lost the battle due to complications from COVID-19. She was a loving mother of 4 and was well-known in the Mienh community and church. She endured the virus for over 3 weeks in the hospital and the majority of her time was spent in the ICU. Her fight against the virus caused a cardiac arrest that stopped her heart. The cardiac arrest brought other complications, but she was given a second chance. During that time, we had the opportunity to visit and say our last goodbyes. Shortly after, her organs started to fail and ultimately led to her passing. She is now in heaven with God, pain-free, and will forever be in our hearts. Rest in peace mom.\\xa0  We wish to give her the proper Mienh burial that she deserves.

Kara’s mom, Carol, sadly also unexpectedly died from COVID-19, just days before Kara’s passing.     \\xa0     Kara had been hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 over Thanksgiving weekend. Her mother, husband and children also all contracted the virus. After weeks in the hospital, the doctors released Kara, who was elated to be home in time for Christmas with her husband and children. After two days at home, she fainted and was rushed by ambulance back to the hospital. She suffered a collapsed lung and was put on a ventilator. Kara, being the incredibly strong woman that she was, fought hard through the night, Preston never leaving her side. Her vitals showed signs of stabilizing and there was cause for hope as everyone continued to pray for Kara’s recovery. However, the damage to Kara’s lungs and pressure on her heart caused irreparable damage to her organs. After a long fight, heaven gained an angel on December 22.       There are not enough words to describe how amazing of a woman Kara was. She touched so many lives with her contagious smile and laugh, hilarious sense of humor, and unconditional love for her seven children and husband of 25 years. Kara was the consummate mother and role model for her children, their best friend and biggest supporter. She loved them unconditionally and raised them with Preston to be equally as loving, moral, and family oriented. Saying goodbye to their mom is the most difficult and unimaginable thing these kids will ever have to go through.     \\xa0     Kara and Preston each worked incredibly hard to provide for their family. Kara worked full time from home while also caring for her youngest child Grayson (4). However, Kara and Carol’s deaths have now left the family in a state of shock and disbelief, trying to process what has happened, and pick up the pieces of their lives without their mom or their grandma, and Preston without his best friend and wife. The family now faces a difficult financial battle, with mounting medical bills from Kara’s extended hospital stay and funeral costs for mom and grandma. In addition, Preston needs to arrange childcare for his youngest children, Grayson and Victoria, and continue to pay for ongoing bills without Kara’s income. Please help this family in need and ease their financial burden by donating to support Kara’s family. If you are unable to donate, please say a prayer for Preston and the kids and cherish every moment you have with your family. On behalf of the Tornell family, thank you for your support. Go hug your loved ones tight, stay safe and God bless.  ',\n",

       " \"  Friends,     It is with great sorrow that I say my father Bill Moore passed on September 3rd from COVID-19. He was a beloved friend, brother, pastor, dad, and husband. He will be deeply missed. Though we are still reeling from his death and processing that he will no longer be with us, we are also thinking about the future for my mother, Tina Moore. They were planning to build a house they could retire in together, but due to mounting medical costs they had already been cutting into their funds to buy a home. I know my dad would want my mom to finish their dream and to live a happy life in the new home they dreamed of, but now with the addition of the medical bills from his fight with COVID and the funeral, more of those funds are being funneled away from their dreams and into bills. Help me see out the dream my dad had for his wife, help us build a safe place for my mom to rebuild the life she now has to live without my dad.     \\xa0     My dad did try to plan ahead for mom financially, he had a life insurance plan that he had purchased when he was 21 years old from the company he was working for. He had kept it for many years, but when he was in the hospital last October for a month due to an infection, which cost him half his colon, the policy lapsed. The company did not work with him. The policy he had been paying on for 43 years, his plan to cover his medical cost so he would not be burdening my mom, was gone. He tried to start a new one, but he didn't live long enough for it to mature. So, despite his effort, he was not able to leave mom with what she needed to pay off all his bills. There are a lot of bills too. The funeral will cost around 8k or more, his chemo treatments from this year were upwards of 35k, and we still have no idea what 2 weeks in the hospital, plus 1 week in the ICU fighting COVID will cost us. It won't be cheap.     \\xa0     My dad fought hard to live, he worked hard to build a life for his family, and he looked forward to life as a grandpa. Though he may not get to live out the retired grandpa life he dreamed of, I hope you will help him pave the way to leave a good grandma life for my mom. A small part of the life they dreamed of living together by helping pay for his medical bills and funeral cost.     \\xa0      strong The fight, Dad's longer medical story  /strong (where all those bills come from):     My dad has been a fighter for a long time. 6 years ago my dad's kidneys failed after he had a heart bypass. He put himself on many lists hoping to get a kidney before dialysis took its toll on his body. But his health deteriorated to quickly and the chance of him making it long enough to get a kidney from a random donor look dismal. Faced with losing her husband, my mom stepped up and gave her kidney to my dad. It was a deep act of love and an investment of hope that we could have him for another 10 years. That Christmas he faced very serious rejection and we thought we might lose him anyway. Yet somehow he fought his way back to health.     \\xa0     He was doing pretty good, but then in the summer of 2020 he got sick, due to his immune-suppressing medicine for mom's kidney living in him. The doctors thought he had overcome it, but then in October they discovered the infection was still there and it had been destroying his colon. His colon ruptured and he lost half of it. He fought hard and even though the doctors told him he shouldn't be alive- he kept fighting. He was shaken though. Mom and dad's house was not in good shape. They couldn't keep up with the mounting issues and maintenance. He pushed my mom to selling it in hopes they could buy a newer home that didn't need as much maintenance. So he wasn't leaving her with a mess and because honestly, he couldn't do the work anymore. They were going to move into a rental for a few months while they went house hunting, but the house prices shot up far beyond what they had sold their home for. They had to rethink their plans- to buy something smaller. With nothing on the market, they decided the only way they could be in their own home again was to build. This was my dad's hope for both of them. The dream I deeply want my mom to have despite all of the medical costs building up.     \\xa0     In October, they also found out that he had a nodule on his lung, but his doctors told him he needed to get stronger before they could remove it. They assured him it would be okay, that he had lots of time to take care of it, but they were wrong. In April after months of healing from his colon abruption, he returned to take care of the nodule, but due to medicine he was on to keep his transplanted kidney safe- it had expanded into a giant mass in his left lung. Within a month it was clear- he had stage 3 inoperable lung cancer. As a family, we mourned that we weren't going to keep our dad as long as we had hoped, but he was determined he was going to overcome it. He said he was going to be a witness to the miraculous healing of God and kick cancer's butt. He went through 7 rounds of chemo (each round is 5k in bills) and his cancer was responding well to the treatment. His kidneys became stronger, his hair got thicker, he was walking longer distances, and the mass was shrinking. We were amazed, dad was going to do it again. He was going to push through and overcome this too.     \\xa0     Then he caught COVID. My parents had planned one last big adventure when my dad was diagnosed with cancer. They didn't know what the future would hold and so they planned my dad's dream trip- to Alaska. My dad was so excited, that despite the risk, he broke isolation to go out and buy clothes for their grand adventure. Four days before they were supposed to leave he had sinus symptoms and a fever. He didn't want to go to the hospital. He was terrified he wouldn't get to go on the trip they had planned if he went. But that evening he went to the doctor, just to make sure he didn't have COVID- He tested positive. At first, it seemed like dad was going to kick COVID's butt and overcome it miraculously like so many things before, he even got to spend a few hours in a rehab facility before everything started going downhill. The virus was gone, but the inflammation and micro-clots were still doing damage. He couldn't breathe, they put him on oxygen and within a week he was on a ventilator. The micro-clots took the kidney my mom had so lovingly given him and the resulting dialysis was so hard on his heart, that eventually it could no longer keep up. My dad fought 3 hards weeks. None of his kids were able to see him in the hospital because of quarantine until after he was put into a medically induced coma so he could be on a ventilator. COVID is a terrible and heartbreaking sickness. Even though dad had overcome so many other obstacles, after he had fought so hard so he could retire with my mom and be a grandpa, COVID stole him away from us.     \\xa0     Here is the kicker friends- my dad was vaccinated, he wore a mask, and he did his best to stay away from crowded places. But those like my dad who are vulnerable and fighting for their lives are dependent on others to wear their masks, to get vaccinated, and to social distance. You can't do it for my dad anymore, but we hope you will do it for others.     \\xa0     We also hope you will contribute, even if it's a small amount. Even 5 or 10 dollars from many people will help us put a dent in the tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills and funeral costs my dad has accumulated, many just in this past year. We hope, that instead of having to deal with medical bills, my mom will have a peaceful time to begin the difficult journey to figuring out what life without her husband will be like. Thank you for every gift you can give, we also appreciate any and all prayers lifted up on behalf of our family.     \\xa0     May your family be safe and blessed,     Bethany  \",\n",
       " '  Hello my name is Rick Brabson, I am asking for help for my mother and our family.     \\xa0     My father Richard Brabson tested positive for Covid about a week prior to Christmas 2021. He was handling it fine at home, and then on Christmas weekend, things took a turn for the worst. He was in the hospital with very low oxygen levels by Monday December 27th. He was on and off of ventilators, and receiving several treatments, for what would be diagnosed as Covid Pneumonia shortly after. After about a week of tests, and staying in the hospital receiving treatments, he suffered a massive stroke and heart attack from a clot they say was caused by covid. He underwent rounds of tests, and remained in ICU, ultimately my father lost his battle.     \\xa0     My mother has just retired as of the 1st of the year (making this even harder emotionally), and will not be receiving benefits for months, and will not be receiving much in form of help from my fathers insurance. The bills that she (and us) will be facing from the the hospital, funeral, and other expenses (along with her mortgage, etc.) are going to be way too much to take care of. This is the reason I am reaching out to loved ones, friends, and the communities we know and love to please assist in anyway possible.     \\xa0     Richard Brabson Sr. was the best father I could ask for, the most amazing husband to my mom, and obsessed with his grand children. He lit up rooms, made friends everywhere he went, and absolutely loved life. He never judged people based on anything, and was supportive of anything people he knew were passionate about.     \\xa0     He loved the outdoors, motorcycle rides, hiking, camping, good food, and any kind of festival or celebration he could be a part of. He was known for always bringing the music to the party, smiling at every small thing, laughing at every joke and just trying to be happy in the moment.     \\xa0     He was a big supporter of Veterans (being one himself), loved helping his community, donating to St. Jude\\'s and other Charities he believed in. He was a great man in every way, and we were lucky to have him in our lives.     \\xa0     \\xa0    img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62490549_1641697524647509_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62490549_1641697712874460_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62490549_1641697730315852_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62490549_1641697747220669_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0    img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/62490549_1641697811293951_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0  ',\n",

They are truly kind, caring and amazing people!         Eileen has been battling covid pneumonia for weeks now and has been admitted to the hospital for the third time. She was admitted on the 26th and her oxygen levels keep fluctuating and dropping. She\\'s had to be away from her children and her husband and been in quarantine for weeks in addition to being in the hospital. She was not able to visit her dad as she didn\\'t want to risk exposing him to covid due to some underlying health conditions he had. Unfortunately her dad Mike ended up being exposed by someone at his work and contracted covid-19.         Covid quickly took its toll on Mike putting him in the hospital on November 21st and then having to be put on a ventilator in ICU on November 23rd. Unfortunately with covid-19, hospital protocol would only allow for him to have one visitor a day for 1 hour. Mike continued too fight as Tina would come and check on him every day but it became too much for his body to handle. On November 29th just yesterday Mike succumbed to the battle of Covid. Fortunately the girls were able to say goodbye and the wonderful nurses at the hospital we\\'re able to take Eileen in a wheelchair up to the ICU to say goodbye.         As we all know life throws us curve balls, and a lot of times we\\'re not prepared. I am asking if you could find it in your heart to donate anything to help Eileen with the medical bills that are starting to pile up and also to help Mike\\'s girl\\'s cover the cost of his cremation and funeral expenses.

       " 'Hello, I\\'m Delphia. I\\'ve started this GoFundMe for my best friend Danielle Hanna and her family. COVID has wreaked havoc on Danielle\\'s family since Thanksgiving with the most tragic part being the loss of her Dad, Tim Cannon to COVID at the age of 51, on December 30th.   \\xa0     Family and friends honored the incredible person Tim was with a beautiful memorial service including military honors on Saturday, January 8, 2021. Tim was a Navy vet who served his country for 6 years. After his honorable discharge from the Navy, Tim moved back to the states and met Danielle\\'s mom. Tim quickly became a father to Danielle and her brother, Mark. Tim was the ultimate family man. He was the best husband to his wife Pam, the best parent, grandparent, uncle, and friend.     \\xa0     Besides losing one of the most incredible men to ever walk the earth, COVID has devastated the family in other ways. Danielle, her mom, her dad, her son, and her grandfather, who was visiting from Florida, all contracted COVID at the end of November. Danielle, her mom and grandfather were all admitted to the hospital for COVID for a short time. Tim was in the hospital during all of December. During that time, the rest of the family started to make their own recovery and spent as much time as they could at the hospital with Tim. Danielle and her mom and grandfather are still recovering physically.     \\xa0     Before getting infected with COVID all three adults in the home worked. The whole house has been out of work since Thanksgiving. To be rocked with medical bills, funeral costs, all during the holidays. The entire house feels like they\\'re drowning in a financial crisis. I just want to help. They lost the glue to their family when they lost Tim. Let\\'s help glue some of the pieces back together.     \\xa0     The family wants to thank everyone who donated to them on the facebook donation page. I started this page for them because it was requested by people who don\\'t want to use the facebook platform.     \\xa0     Thank you in advance for your generosity in helping Danielle and her family get back on their feet. Thanks, Delphia     \\xa0     P.S. Here is a facebook post from Danielle on January 1st. I wanted to share it for those who aren\\'t on facebook:     I really want to say thank you. Tim Cannon went to Heaven with a piece of each of our hearts. We\\'ll never be whole again, ever. Despite knowing that, we will try to find happiness again. The laughs will never be as loud and the smiles will never be as bright. Tim loved his family so incredibly much and it was a love we felt so deeply. It\\'s irreplaceable. He\\'d want us to continue on and we will. But there\\'s always going to be an emptiness and there\\'s always going to be something missing.

       " '  Our hearts are broken for Michelle and her 4 beautiful sweet girls as they lost Scott after a 9-week battle in the hospital. The original purpose of this Gofundme was to assist them with bills and ongoing expenses coming up, but now we have also added the expense of moving forward for this family without their key provider.\\xa0 Michelle and the girls have a hard road ahead and will need as much support as we can give them. Please share and help in any way possible.  We\\'ve created this GoFundMe to help with expenses that we know will be coming up for Scott &amp; Michelle\\'s family. Recently, Scott contracted Covid-19, and ended up being hospitalized, and now vented, fighting for his life. Michelle &amp; Scott have a beautiful family and farm, and since Scott has been sick, there has been no income for their family, and medical bills will continue to only rise. Regardless of the outcome, their family will be struggling financially for the foreseeable future, and with all of the things going on right now, this is one area that we can all help with to lessen the stress during this horrible situation. We are all not just their friends, but family. Please consider donating anything at all to help them get through this rough patch. We will post updates below that Michelle posts so that you can read their story and keep up with them. Please consider checking back on here to continue to contribute if you can. \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59872697_1631293536111943_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/10/21 - 11:40pm  /strong For a week, I was adamant about not having one of these set up. We\\'d figure it out. I\\'m currently in a spot I don\\'t think I can feasibly figure out now.  Scott lost his job last November due to Covid. He ended up taking a temporary job this year just to have some income. It was significantly lower than he made before but we did second jobs (both) to make it work. BC his job is temp, he currently has zero medical insurance, life insurance, and no FMLA paid leave benefits.  I am currently realizing just how deep into the darkness I am with bills, both medical and regular, and possibly a funeral. I cant do this, I\\'m ashamed to admit. Scott was the bread winner around here.  I hate asking for help, but I kept looking at my girls pretending it was going to be okay, knowing its not. Even if a miracle happens, it\\'ll be months before he comes home. I am trying hard to do it on my own bc I\\'ve never had to ask for help and it embarrasses me, but I\\'ve got 4 sets of little eyes looking to me to be there for them in the ways Scott and I both were there, shelter them, and protect them. All whilst trying to be there for him as well. Being thrown to the fires this hard, unexpectedly, has made me realistic about my situation. And its a pickle for sure. strong   Update from Michelle: 9/10/21 - 12:49pm /strong  My heart is so heavy and mad right now I can\\'t even process what I\\'m feeling. Today, I\\'ve learned that my love now has a very rare condition, so rare that his cardiologist hasn\\'t ever personally seen it. Its not good. Pneumomediastinum. Write that down and curse every syllable, please? Its effecting his once perfect heart (that he was given a perfect score on just the other day.) The vent is currently working at max for him. \\xa0 All the care teams are currently discussing a course of action, if any, can be taken. But when you\\'re given a very very poor prognosis, at this rate we are needing a miracle for Scott. I\\'m barely holding composure to write this as I\\'m so angry. So hurt. So scared. I\\'m so worried I have to tell my girls their loving Dad is probably going to die. I don\\'t even know how to do that. I don\\'t want to do this life alone, without him. Not at all. He kept telling me he won\\'t survive the vent, and I keep hoping he\\'s wrong as usual. \\xa0 I want to hold his hand and kiss his face, and just snuggle up to him. And I can\\'t do any of that. Maybe not even be able to ever again. I am so broken right now. And hanging onto the hopes that his soul and will to be with us again is stronger than the the things trying to take him away from us. \\xa0 I am going to rest for right now. Terrified of what that future phone call holds for me, and us. Please refrain from actually calling me right now. I cant turn my ringer down bc I need to answer the when the hospital calls. But I am so, so worn out and beaten down, I need to do this so I can be strong for the girls when they get home from school. \\xa0 Continue to message and text,- that\\'s okay- I\\'ve got those silenced, but please....let me rest a bit. And pray harder than you ever have before!!!!!      img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59872697_1631293885637145_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0     \\xa0     \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/9/21 - 12:42pm /strong      9:33 a.m, as I was gathering up things to take up to his room to make it cozy and be of a constant reminder of home, we stopped treading water and dove fully into the deep end.     \\xa0     The hospital called to inform me they would be fully intubating him immediately after I was able to \"talk\" to him. I said my \"I love you\" and got a very emotional, Darth Vader styled \"I love you\" back. Followed by lots of crying and him muttering that he\\'s scared. (Background info for those that don\\'t know. Scott was a respiratory therapist and an Army Medic, served in Desert Storm. He is VERY aware of everything happening right now, the severity of condition he\\'s in, risks with intubation, and mortality rates for his conditions alone, not even including covid). He\\'s terrified. Broke me into so many pieces that I\\'m still trying to pick them up.     \\xa0     His machine started honking ferociously as his vitals were all over the place. And as I was telling him to relax and that I would see him when he wakes up, they had to hang up bc he was getting too upset.     As a roller coaster enthusiast, I don\\'t like this one very much. I\\'ve not even been able to process hurdles and emotionally deal with them before being thrown to the fires with the next.     \\xa0     I hope this isn\\'t the trend from here on out.     I hope his ability to fully rest will heal him with no more setbacks.     I hope he\\'s awake in a week.     I mostly hope his fears do not come to fruition.     I need this man to come back home to us.     \\xa0     But we never have done shit the easy way, have we?     Today we took two steps back, and then just decided to gear up in a wing suit and jump off the cliff. Just out here floating around on the wings of hope.     That\\'s where we are.     Please keep our babies in your hearts.     \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/9/21 - 3:46am /strong      One step forward; two steps back. It is just the way we roll around here. Had an emergency visit to the hospital this evening.     \\xa0     Scott\\'s lung x-rays were showing a &lt;2cm pneumothorax (collapsed lung) on one side, and possibly the start of another on the other side. They were doing emergency surgery and he was being taken to ICU for chest tube surgery.     \\xa0     I finally got to see him for the first time and visit with him for a little bit while he was waiting to go into surgery. A VERY emotional visit, as we both knew very well that it could be the last time we saw and spoke to one another. I got the girls on a video call with him so he could see them and they could tell him whatever they wanted. He was VERY emotional during this, so much that I had to hang up so he could calm down and we could get his heart rate and o2 to level back out. I\\'m pretty sure I experienced every single emotion known to man, all in a very short time span. Im also a Cancer, so I\\'m EXTRA on the crybaby gene.     \\xa0     We were also able to scramble together (very last minute) a last will and testament and a POA, after days of trying hard to get it done. A feat not proving to be easy, given the nature of his illness and the no visitors rule, combined with needing it over a holiday weekend, combined with no money to pay for one. But we did it, thanks for the life saving attorney husband of a dear friend of mine. He helped guide me through the constantly evolving situation up there, concerning the whole thing.     \\xa0     This urgent process is not fun. I give it zero out of 5 stars.     During surgery, he had a bit of a tough time, so sedation was increased to make him feel more comfortable.     He expressed his wishes NOT to be intubated unless he absolutely needed it. Having been a respiratory therapist and an Army medic, he fully understands the severity of intubation and how it can negatively effect the lungs with tons of pneumonia. He\\'s already got that badly, he did not want to potentially add more to it. So again, this man has managed to escaped intubation. But still, treading very thin waters.     \\xa0     The good news is he is out of surgery, and doing well currently. The bad news is that he is maxed out on bipap still. Any decreases in vitals will require intubation at this point.     \\xa0     He is terrified of this situation. I think, in part because he isn\\'t confident he would survive it, and in part because has been on the other side of intubation. He knows the whole process, complications, and recovery processes. I hope it\\'s more of the latter.     \\xa0     I\\'m still hoping for miraculous healing without vent work, and no post complications. Please continue to hope, pray, and love to your hearts content. I fear that we are not even close to being out of the water, and have just merely waded in at this point instead.     \\xa0     For those wondering how I am doing (with having covid and dealing with all of this), I am physically fine, mentally exhausted, and emotionally drained. Having said that, it\\'s 3:42 am and I have to get up at 5:30 to start the day. Goodnight and I will keep you all posted......     \\xa0      strong Update from Michelle: 9/7/21 - 9:48am /strong      Most of you reading this are not aware of this, and I apologize. But I wanted to tell everyone why I\\'ve not been responding back to messages/texts about random things. Only 2 handfuls of you know that Scott caught Covid, and we were all quarantined. I had to rush him to the hospital when he was at the tail end of his quarantine bc he started to exhibit severe respiratory distress signs. He was immediately admitted. His o2 sats were only at 50% when he was admitted. He ended up tanking while I was out getting his meds/vitamins/ electrolytes for him, and my covid test. I came back home and honestly thought he had passed bc of the way he looked. Major cyanosis and the rest of his skin was white or ashen. He\\'s been in since his birthday, Monday, August 30th     \\xa0     At this point, I don\\'t know what the outcome will be. As many of you know, its very touch and go with this illness. He\\'s had good days and some really bad, scary ones. He\\'s been on 100% oxygen for most of his stay. His pneumonia is worsening and x-rays yesterday are showing more infiltrates on his lungs.     \\xa0     By whatever grace though, he\\'s NOT been intubated ...yet. And I\\'m double crossing all my fingers and toes he wont be. But he is straddling a really fine line to being so. He\\'s currently on the last step before intubation. Some days improving, while others taking steps back. I keep being told he\\'s looking at weeks in there unless a miracle happens and his infection miraculously heals and clears. But even IF that happens, his road to recovery will be long due to scar tissue on the lungs he will more than likely have coming out.     \\xa0     I\\'m trying very hard to be optimistic but realistic. But slowly getting discouraged.     This week, I\\'m working on preparing a living will for us (bc we didn\\'t have one prior) and I\\'m not going to lie- I\\'m scared shitless. I\\'m stressed for other reasons, and I just want everything to go back to normal. Our normal, which is weird as hell, as you all know.     \\xa0     I don\\'t know what any day brings, but I do know I could really use your prayers, well wishes, good graces, and love. I just want to hear my friends, and my people right now. ❤ I wasn\\'t going to post publicly bc I hate making people fret and worry (and I\\'m relatively a private person in this regard), but so many folks keep trying to reach out to me for random stuff, and because I\\'ve not felt well enough for small talk, I needed to address it.     \\xa0     I ended up catching covid from him and have been at home, alone with the kids, with them to watch out for me. All the while, trying to take care of them AND stay away from them. Not the easiest task by any means.     Please keep him and us in your thoughts. I\\'m banking on your positivity to carry me through bc I know I\\'m going to drown in my own thoughts some days.     Love to you all. And sorry if I don\\'t respond back to you. I don\\'t mean any rudeness.     \\xa0     \\xa0    img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/59872697_163129416417450_r.\" alt=\"\"     /   \\xa0  ',\n",

We need to raise $28,000 by the end of the day of October 25th in order to be able to afford the funeral service. Please consider donating if you are able to do so, as any amount will truly help. We are so very grateful for every donation during this difficult time.     \\xa0     Hi, my name is Victoria, and I\\'m fundraising for the love of my life, my dear husband Dean Shifflett.     Two years ago, we stood united as a family, asking for your support as Dean started his battle with cancer. After over two years of extensive treatments and enduring its effects on his body both physically and mentally, Dean was finally in remission.     We got engaged, moved back to Virginia to be closer to friends and family, and Dean started a new job.     He was finally able to start a \"normal\" life, and once again, he finds himself fighting for his life.     Today we ask for support in fighting Dean\\'s new enemy, COVID.     As many of you have seen on Facebook or heard, on August 20, 2021, Dean was diagnosed with COVID-19, despite being vaccinated, due to his compromised immune system. He was sent home to quarantine and rest. However, each day he was getting worse, and on August 30, 2021, he was hospitalized with COVID double pneumonia and a clot in his lung.     In the first week of him being in the hospital, doctors changed his medication regimen several times due to a rapid progression in his pneumonia.     Week two, Dean was put on a high-flow oxygen machine, and doctors struggled to keep his oxygen at the optimum level. Unfortunately, several times his oxygen levels dropped to the critical level causing him to faint.     On September 13, 2021, Dean was transferred to the MCU unit needing more intensive medical care. The high-flow oxygen machine was working on 100%, and he was heavily sedated.     His body was worn out, and his lungs were tired from labored breathing. Despite doctors\\' efforts to keep him off the ventilator, sadly, yesterday, September 16, 2021, Dean was transferred to ICU and intubated.     Earlier this week, I received the notice that Dean is out of his sick days and will need to go on personal leave (which is unpaid) or file for short-term disability (60% of his pay) what we are working on now.     Medical bills are adding up as we are still paying the bills incurred from cancer treatment.     \\xa0     Please consider a donation to help with increasing medical expenses.     We are asking for prayers of healing and recovery for Dean.  ',\n",
       " \"  My name is Stacey and I have started this urgent GoFundMe for a family in great need. My dear sister and her family had a horrendous year of trauma and loss, the last of which, and the most heartbreaking is the passing of her husband and soulmate on October 4, 2021 after a month long stay in the hospital for covid, of which the last 19 days were spent on a ventilator. Jenny and Osvaldo Diez were married for 35+ years, have 7 children together, the eldest of which preceded his father in death at the age of 20. They were married in Seattle and eventually ended up in North Carolina, where they have lived for the last 17 years, sending their kids to college, gardening, working, and taking care of their beloved kitties.         Osvaldo was an amazing man, provider and human being. He was kind. He was known to be reserved, but had a wonderfully dry sense of humor. He was strong and brilliant, just like my sister as well as their children. He was also dedicated, responsible and loyal which showed in his relationship with Jenny, and in the many years at his workplace with IBM. My brother-in-law was also the sole provider for his large family, five of which were in college and paying their own way until they had to put their academia on hold due to loss of employment from the pandemic.         This close-knit family not only lost their husband and father, but prior to this and through no fault of their own, they also lost their home and are currently residing in an office space that is not really habitable, occasionally going to a hotel for showers. And just today their new (to them) vehicle put out warning lights indicating serious electrical problems and they no longer have transportation. They are homeless, cashless, jobless, stranded, and grieving. The medical expenses of round-the-clock ICU care and specialty medical treatment Osvaldo received is substantial. Jenny is too young for survivor benefits and they cannot get jobs without transportation and a secure address. They can't even hold a memorial or funeral due to the cost, so extended family and friends of Osvaldo in Bolivia and throughout the United States can't come together to remember this amazing person, friend, father and husband.         This family is a true casualty of the pandemic and they need help to rebuild their lives: A secure home which will likely require First/Last/Deposit and possibly advanced payment; Funds to repair their vehicle; Help to pay the exorbitant medical bills; They need money for food, gas, utilities, storage...all the things so that they can grieve the loss of their patriarch, regroup, and just breathe. Please help.  \",\n",

On August 9th 2021 my grandfather was emitted to the hospital with COVID 19. On August 10th his health quickly declined and was unfortunately rushed to the ICU and put on a ventilator. While in the hospital we discovered that he also contracted pneumonia and has diabetes. It is now August 27th, and thankfully his pneumonia has passed and his diabetes is under control. Holding his breath, the doctor told my family and I that there is a chance he may recover! ( strong My old man is a fighter!!! /strong )     However, now he is in need of surgery to assist with his breathing ASAP! The operation he will undergo is called a Tracheostomy. My grandfather, Cesar, needs this operation done if there is any chance for him to get off the ventilator and begin his journey to recovery and breathing on his own.     \\xa0     Cesar lives in Guatemala.      strong As we all know, the healthcare systems in other countries do not have the leniency to perform operations without the funds provided upfront /strong . In just little over 2 weeks he\\'s already incurred $62,480 in hospital bills, which continue to pile up and none has been covered by insurance. All of my grandfathers and grandmothers savings, plus retirement money has gone to paying $42,450 of the $60,480. ( strong The goal is set to pay off his current balance, the surgery and assist with future medical bills /strong ).     My family and I truly thank you and appreciate any donations towards his surgery.     We all miss our Papa Cesar, and we just want him to come back home.     Thank you for your time.  ',\n",
       " '  The Chavez family has been through so much heartache. Approximately 4 years ago Gabriel Chavez received the news he had cancer it started as a tumor in his brain. It was successfully removed, then he had 15 rounds of radiation on his head accompanied by chemotherapy. To then find out he had stage 4 lung cancer and as the cancer spread through his body he never lost hope or faith. He was such a kind man and so strong through everything that he was going through. While going through this he lost his wife and step son on November 8th, 2020 due to covid and several complications. To the entire Chavez family this was the biggest devastation losing two loved ones at once. Fast forward through depression and his cancer advancing around October 2021, we received news that things had progressed too far. We started seeing what once was a cheerful, independent, full of life man become bed bound and slowly losing all his ability to take care of himself and in pain due to this horrible cancer. He was referred to hospice care at home since they said their was nothing more to do, medically they lost hope but we didnt. Meanwhile one of his sons Gabriel Jr. was fighting for his life in the hospital with covid on a ventilator.  Sadly Gabriel Chavez Sr. lost his battle to cancer and took his last breath Tuesday December 21, 2021. As this yet again for the Chavez family is another devastating tragedy a little over a year of the last one. While we would rather grieve \"Chavez\" as we all called him we sadly have to be focused on funeral expenses. We ask for your generosity in this tough time, their is no donation to little anything helps.

He was a devoted husband to Christina and an incredible loving Dad to Linkin (age 9). John always said he picked the name Linkin because Linkin was the missing “Link” in their life.            John was admitted to the hospital a little over two weeks ago. Christina never imagined that would be the last time she would be able to hug him and have a normal goodbye. John has been battling Covid on a ventilator for two weeks. He fought so hard to beat this virus. Christina has been so strong and checked on him daily for updates, while also caring for Linkin. Unfortunately with the restrictions for covid no one was able to visit him. This has been so incredibly heart breaking.            John was such a hard working, funny, supportive, and loving man. He would do anything for his family and friends. John was the main provider for Christina and Linkin. Christina was a stay at home Mom caring for Linkin.\\xa0 After spending that much time in the hospital there will be many hospital bills to come, along with a funeral service for John that can be expensive.            Our hope for this fund is to help with medical bills, funeral expenses, and to help Christina during this time. Any donation helps.            Thank you so much to everyone for the prayers and support you’ve given the family and John. Throughout this heart breaking time.\\xa0 John you will be forever loved and missed. You will be with all of us forever and never be forgotten.         ',\n",
       " '       Hi, my name is Monica Quesada.  I am a niece of Alfredo Unate aka Fred or Freddy.  For this message, I\\'m going to just refer to him as Freddy.  Freddy passed away unexpectedly on Saturday October 23, 2021.  It was a total shock to us all.  For a week he was in ICU because of Covid on a ventilator, sedated with a feeding tube. Friday night before his passing, he was doing good, according to the doctors and nurses.  Saturday morning, his heart just stopped.  Doctors and nurses tried everything they could to bring him back.  Actually they did get that golden heart pumping again.  But, God was ready for him.  Although Freddy was in the hospital, he was not alone.  He had all our love, support and prayers.              Freddy loved life! Man did he enjoy everything he did.  He loved his family dearly and he loved his friends.  He loved his job up in Black Hawk.  I heard he was pretty darn good at it!  He will be missed. He\\'ll be missed at holidays, and family/friends \"cookouts\" as he called it.  Life just is not the same.  Fred had a heart of gold.  If you asked for help, he\\'d do it without complaints or hesitation.  Freddy was always so thoughtful and caring.           I\\'m asking for donations to help pay for funeral expenses.  Like I mentioned before, we were not expecting this outcome.  We were ready for him to come home.  Anything helps.  Thank you all in advance.        ',\n",
       " '   strong Update: We just found out their insurance runs out at the end of November.\\xa0   /strong Heather and Frank have had a brutal last couple of years. \\xa0Frank is now battling colon cancer and Heather recently lost her job because of the time she\\'s had to take off to support Frank, making both of them unemployed. On top of that, they will both lose their health insurance by the end of November 2021. They have reached a breaking point physically, emotionally, and financially. \\xa0They have no savings left and the bills are mounting. They may loss their home and everything the\\'ve worked for. Heather is struggling daily with her anxiety and depression from all the trauma. \"Just taking a shower or leaving the house is a chore,\" she says. Couple that with Frank\\'s upcoming surgery and chemo appointments and the caregiving she\\'ll need to provide Frank and it\\'s clear that Heather needs some help.   Thank you for whatever you can give. Share the link if you\\'re inspired to do so on your social media and join me in sending them positive healing vibes as they are much needed at this time.   strong Who I and why I\\'m doing this:\\xa0 /strong  My name is Camille, a good friend of Heather and Frank, and am starting this go fund me page to help them get through a devastating and horrific life experience that has been going on for over a year and a half now. It continues today. They are on the cusp of running out of all their savings and are now dealing with a new medical situation that has put their lives in a precarious situation. (You may remember Heather and Frank\\'s story in last year\\'s Anchorage Daily News posted August 29th, 2020. See link below.) I am here to raise $10,000 to help them with their medical expenses and bring some much needed income into their daily living so they can keep their home and make ends meet. It\\'s been tough getting Frank and Heather to say yes to this because they are not takers; they\\'re givers. However I told them that it was time for them to receive.     \\xa0      strong A Summary of their Trauma /strong      Last June, after spending five days in the hospital where Heather had her neck fused at seven levels front and back, she returned home. The next day Frank didn\\'t feel well and Heather took his temperature. It read 106.4. He drove himself to the ER while Heather, shocked and scared, stayed behind unable to move because of her surgery. Frank\\'s condition worsened and continued to deteriorate upon arrival. Oxygen tubes went in his nose and his doctor confirmed he had COVID-19 on his second day there.     \\xa0     Meanwhile Heather was now in quarantine for ten days and unable to have anyone come into the home. Frank was suppose to be her caregiver and assist with rehabilitation but that plan was no longer in play. Heather struggled to care for herself alone and went five days without a shower because she couldn’t properly cover her incisions. Though she could reach Frank by phone, he labored to talk. Frank\\'s condition was so bad that he was put into a negative pressure room where he was on high flow oxygen for two weeks. He wondered if he’d survive.\\xa0“For about a week, it got real bad,” he says.     \\xa0     Heather, home alone with her own worry, fell into a routine of calling Frank’s nurses each morning at 11 a.m., hoping for good news. However, for several days the news was bleak. After nearly three weeks of treatment, Frank was able to return home but had to now quarantine himself and couldn\\'t even hug his wife.     \\xa0     A day after returning home, after 24 years of work, Frank lost his job.     \\xa0     In the weeks that followed, Frank lost his brother just a year after losing their father. Heather lost her mom and between the two of them over ten friends and family members died. The stress of this trauma was clear to me at Heather\\'s mother\\'s funeral. I became very concerned about their mental and emotional health as this was clearly way more than two people should be given to deal with. Those close to Heather know that she has also been a caregiver to her step-father and her mother for over ten years. In 2019 alone, Heather took them to the hospital a total of 42 times! As a caregiver myself, I know personally the debilitating effect full time caregiving does to a person. The wear and tear is real yet can go unnoticed by those closest to them.     \\xa0     Fast forward to the weekend of September 24th, 2021. Frank had a colonoscopy that revealed he has colon cancer. Laster that day, Heather lost her job. The next day, Frank found out he had a heart attack back in August when he was hospitalized again for unknown reasons. That afternoon, Frank\\'s daughter Jenny, seven month\\'s pregnant was hospitalized after testing positive for COVID. On a ventilator for two weeks, they put her into a deep coma and delivered the baby who weighed 3.7 lbs. The baby also had to be put on a ventilator. As I write this, Frank is scheduled for a CAT scan this week. They also need to do a stress test to see if his heart can handle the two surgeries needed to remove the large mass. Then there\\'s the chemo and radiation.     \\xa0     Though it\\'s still very uncomfortable for them to allow me to do this, they have no other option. Please help as you can. I will keep you updated as things unfold. If you believe in the power of prayer, please join me in calling forth the miracle needed. Thank you so much.

       " '  My dad was taken to the ER 12/30 where he tested positive for Covid &amp; placed on a ventilator in ICU 1/2. Nurses were saying things were moving in the right direction &amp; using the word “stable” numerous times until things suddenly took a turn for the worse &amp; then he was gone. My mom &amp; I are in shock &amp; have to figure out a way to pay for the funeral arrangements as well as keep up on our many past due bills.\\xa0     ——- My dad was a kind hearted man who loved his family more than anything. He was a strong man and was never afraid of anything. I only ever saw him cry one time in my life - when my brother passed away.   He always worked hard and did his best to ensure that my mom &amp; I were happy. He would give you his last penny or the shirt off his back as he was just that caring. He was also a very talented musician and was truly amazing if you ever had the opportunity to hear him play the piano, keyboard &amp;/or the accordion. When I was younger, we’d always have family/friends over and my dad would always brighten up our gatherings with his great talent! My dad was always taking pictures &amp; videos of our family &amp; friends so no moment could be forgotten.    He always had so many friends &amp; everyone that knew him would tell you what a great man he was &amp; how selfless he was when it came to helping others out.  Unfortunately, my time with my dad was cut short when he passed 1/4/21 due to complications from Covid-19. He had been in the ER due to shortness of breath since 12/30. They started him on oxygen &amp; next thing we knew he was in the ICU on a ventilator, heavily sedated. Nurses told us that the ventilator would allow more time for my dad’s body to fight the virus and heal without having to focus on just breathing which his body was working so hard to do. My mom &amp; I were able to see him via FaceTime twice while in ICU although he was not conscious/responsive we still talked in hopes that he could still hear us. My mom &amp; I spent our new year’s at home alone full of worry waiting for the next update from the hospital praying for some good news which never came. We were not allowed to be there with him &amp; did not have a chance to actually say goodbye as the last time we ever saw him was via FaceTime.   My dad was a fighter &amp; I was so sure he would make it home eventually but Covid-19 took him away from us too soon! The house is so empty now without my dad here. Our family went from 4 people to 2 people in a matter of years. He will always be remembered and missed dearly.   My mom &amp; I are truly in shock/lost/devastated without my dad here with us. I have created this gofundme in hopes of raising money to help us cover all the costs associated with my dad’s funeral and such.   My mom &amp; I are currently unemployed due to the pandemic &amp; while we have been struggling to make ends meet for months now, the struggle has now become impossible to manage on our own.   We thank you in advance for any contribution.   Stay safe!     Dorsa    ',\n",

       " \"  I'm lost on what to say. I can't believe we're here. How is this real life??     As most of you know, my father Paul Rand is in the hospital for covid pneumonia. He's on a ventilator and in critical condition. He went into the hospital due to low oxygen and from there everything went downhill. First, he developed blood clots in his lungs and became high risk for a heart attack. Then he developed holes in his lungs, leading to his right lung collapsing. This resulted in him needing a tube placed in his chest and him being placed on a ventilator. At this point he was sedated and placed into a medically induced coma. Paul was transferred to a hospital in the cities, as they are more equipped to deal with someone on a ventilator. Not long after being at the new hospital his left lung collapsed and another tube was inserted on his other side. The hospital's approved treatments are not helping him. We, his family, would like to try giving him Ivermectin. He has a prescription for it, but it arrived after he was admitted to the hospital. The hospital is refusing to give it to him. We would like to hire a lawyer, and expert witnesses, to get him Ivermectin. There are multiple studies from other countries showing that Ivermectin has helped. Being that the hospital is unable to help him with their approved medications, we'd like them to try Ivermectin. To get them to do so, we have to sue them. Please, I beg of you, help us raise the funds to try to save our dad's life.     \\xa0     You can donate here, where a processing fee will be deducted from your donation, or you can donate to my Venmo (@KimberlyRand) or Paypal ([email redacted]). If you do so by selecting Friends &amp; Family, no deduction will be taken from your donation. THANK YOU!!  Please note: If Paul passes before lawyers are obtained, the money will be used for his funeral. If Paul recovers before lawyers are obtained, the money will be used for medical expenses.\\xa0  \",\n",

I lived with my father for my 45 years of life. Everyday after his passing has been painful for me emotionally and now financially as well. I have a urgent need to get him a proper funeral before the State of Michigan takes over and put him in an unmarked grave with just a number. By the grace of god he does not deserve to be buried in such a way. He was a great man who loved his family and he had a passion for guitar playing and guns. He liked pellet and bb guns especially. His smile is infectious and he can be a real goof ball and this what our family loved about him. Also he was always helpful and was really good with his hands I mean really smart. He is survived by his girlfriend of 23 years and they have 2 daughters together ages 10 and 15. Also he his survived by myself and my 2 other sisters who are 39 and 41. Finally, he is survived by various family members out of state and out of the country and friends all around. Our family is going to miss him greatly and we feel he deserves a proper burial. Anything that anyone can help out with would be a blessing. I will be in charge of his funeral expenses should we meet our goal. Thank you all and god bless.

Don was moved to an Acute Care Hospital to open up beds at the Memorial Hospital. He seemed to be getting better but was subsequently rushed to Stanford Medical Hospital in Palo Alto, CA. Then Don took a turn for the worse and all the fine medical staff there could not save him.\\xa0 The family had to make the heart wrenching decision to let him pass without Margaret knowing as she was still heavily sedated.  The next month was a constant battle for Margaret with daily, if not hourly, phone consults with her doctors and nurses... last rights were administered from the hallway of the hospital...for our approval of blood transfusions, invasive procedures and medicine changes as the COVID virus attacked different parts of her body.\\xa0 6 weeks later ICU COVID\\xa0 hospital beds were needed so she was moved to an Acute Care Hospital as some doctors beleived she was beyond survival while others protected her life...How did we know what to do when making medical decissions from 900 miles away.\\xa0 The Acute Care Hospital wanted her moved out to make room for other patients so she was moved to All Saints Sub Acute Care Hospital in San Leandro, CA over an hour away from home.

Margaret will be faced with lingering side effects to her kindneys and heart not to mention the emotional event of putting her husband of 30 years to rest.\\xa0 While most of her medical bills are covered there are many that are not...she is faced with the cost of returning home to Modesto from San Leandro, CA which is not paid for by insurance.\\xa0 She has no family or close friends that drive to take her home.\\xa0 It was estimated at close to $500 to have her transported from All Saints to her home.\\xa0 In additon, there as not enough money in Don's meager funeral fund for his funeral costs.\\xa0\\xa0  Margaret now lives on Social Security that is minimal as she work ed most of her adult life at fast food resturants and since her husband passed away she has lost one other income from Social Security.\\xa0 She has two adult son's who are learning disabled with one son who lives at home and is working two part time days a week at another fast food resturant.\\xa0 They're in need of support to set up Margaret's home health needs and ongoing medical treatments that may not be paid by Medicare\\xa0 as well as Don's funeral expenses.

       " \"My name is Kristopher Martin. I have lived with my father since I was 14. I am now 38. In 2010 my dad had a stroke. I have had power of attorney since 2010 and have been the only person that handled dad's bills. He did rehab and learned how to walk, talk, feed himself, and do everything with his opposite hand. About 5 years ago he had brain surgery and came back from that. Other things came along... Cancer, heart problems, pretty much anything a person can go through he continued to fight. Dad finally lost his battle on March 28th. Since 2010 but mainly these last 3 years dad needed 24 hour care. He did not want to lose our home which his parents had bought in 1962. I was out of work at the time so it was not a problem for me. I took my dad to every appointment, fed him, bathed him, anything he needed. Fast forward to today... I have 2 half siblings from dad's previous marriage. I don't know these people I've probably meet them twice in my life and NEVER not once did they EVER call and talk to their dad or ask us if we needed help. Didn't even come to the hospital before I took dad off of life support. The same night my dad passed away my half brother (Scott Martin) called my dad's best friend and told him how he (Scott Martin) wants to help me out with the cost of the funeral, help me with bills to stay in my house that I have lived in since 2001. Turns out Scott is a 2 faced liar. He went down to the courthouse behind my back and was named administrator of the estate. Now I am being ordered out of my home by 6/12/2021. I got a job right after dad passed but it's not enough to cover the incurring attorney fees. I have not even had a chance to mourn for my dad because I've been working and fighting with my half siblings. I have lived here for over 20 years. My whole life is here, my personal belongings, my vehicles. I'm not in the best health and I have no place to go. I took care of my dad because I loved him very much. We had a special relationship. I didn't want anything in return. My dad thought that he had made a will years ago but when I went down there a month before dad passed the attorney said that it had never been finalized. I kind of forgot about it for like most people tend to do because dad was getting better and I was spending my time with him in the hospital. Dad did make it back to our home for 3 days but I had to call the ambulance because he wasn't eating or drinking. He was mad at me for calling because he didn't want to go back to the hospital but I had to. He yelled at me when they came in the door and said thanks a lot Kristopher. I never got to talk to my dad again as next time I saw him was a day later and he had COVID-19 and was on a ventilator . My dad wanted me to have everything after he was gone. He made that clear to many people. It isn't much but it meant a lot to him and me. Now a magistrate (Brian Buckmeier) ruled me out of my house of over 20 years because I'm not the administrator! Obviously he couldn't of looked at ANY of the facts of the case. That I have lived there for 20 years, that my dad's wishes were for me to inherit everything, that I took care of my dad, the fact that my half siblings NEVER called or wanted anything to do with us/their dad during this whole time he was sick. Every decision has gone against me because I'm not the administrator. I am having my attorney file paperwork to have Scott removed as administrator. This is not right! My dad was a very good and decent man and it was my pleasure to take care of him. I just wish he was still here. I'm basically trying to start my life from scratch. I have no kids, never been married, I have a job but I'm not satisfied. I am willing to do anything to better myself and my life! I'm highly motivated but with everything that's been going on lately it's overwhelming. I am trying very hard on my own but I think I'm going to need some help to get my head above water. Thank you very much for listening to my story.\",\n",

       " \"  Our beloved Mother overcame Covid 19 pneumonia while being on a ventilator, a diabetic coma, and multiple strokes on both sides of her brain all at once for a week and a half. Within 2 days of being admitted to ACMC the doctors counted her out and gave her husband and her kids two options which were giving her a trach and feeding tube and to live the rest of her life in a nursing home. Or taking her off the ventilator and put her on comfort measurements with hospice. Our mother improved and show the doctors that she was controlling her own destiny. And came off the ventilator in a week and a half. She also lost her ability to speak, walk, sit up, and no physical control in her hands making her unable to feed herself. Since the ventilator was taken out she used her eyes to communicate yes and no to moving her head to jester yes and no, to start speaking in a soft whisper tone to finally projecting her voice loud enough to speak and start asking for what she wanted, and answering questions. Since being in a nursing home for the past two and half weeks our Mom improved up to 85%. While having speech, physical, and occupational therapy our Mom started to move both legs as if she was ready to walk, and during electric stimulation our Mom started moving her arms and hands wanting to feed and take care of herself on her own. After overcoming all these obstacles to lose her life due to someone else's negligence. These are the reasons why we are fighting for Justice For Our Beloved Lulu. Lulu's family is reaching out asking for any donations towards her Celebration of Life and funeral expenses.

       " \"  Hi. This is Becky, Laurie and Dan Rochin helping Paty Rochin raise funds for medical bills and cremation/funeral for our youngest brother, Stevie, who passed away due to complications from Covid-19.          Steven Arnold Rochin was born on March 11, 1963 and passed away on December 5, 2021. He was predeceased by his mother,  Elvira Partida Rochin (Vicky) on November 1, 1993 and his father Mario Arnoldo Rochin on September 13, 2017. He attended Los Ninos Elementary School and graduated from Catalina High School in 1981. He raced motocross bikes when he was in his teens. A long time ago, although I can't remember exactly when, our brother, Dan, nicknamed him: The Beave. His family and friends called him Beave or Beaver for years. Although many knew him as Stevie.          Stevie was a hard working pool construction worker most of his adult life, until he got sick.  He lived a simple life and had greatly calloused hands from all his years of installing rebar for inground pools. He was also very tanned due to being outdoors for his work. He was a handsome man that was generous. Stevie was an excellent golfer. He could win at dart tournaments because he was very skilled at throwing darts. He had a large extended family and many friends that loved him. He was a father figure to Danielle, the daughter of Barbie. He took good care of Danielle for many years.         Stevie married Paty in the mid 2000's. He stayed with Paty until his death. She is very distraught and has no money to pay for his cremation/burial. In late October of this year, Stevie got very sick. He couldn't breathe. Paty had to call 911 and he went to the hospital. As it turns out he had severe Covid-19 and was put on a ventilator immediately. He was very very very sick. He was unvaccinated and had underlying conditions. He fought for over a month until he finally lost his battle and passed away. If you are not vaccinated for Covid-19, please get the vaccination and booster.           Stevie was loved by all his family and friends and will be greatly missed. If you can find it in your heart to help Paty with medical bills and the cremation etc. Please do so.   \",\n",

He owned his own Acupuncture practice and enjoyed helping people daily. He was admitted to Bayhealth Sussex on 10/18 with Covid Pneumonia. We fully anticipated him recovering and coming back home to us as we were told he would be. Dad went through a lot of ups and downs during his hospital stay but we never imagined him not coming home. After beating covid and covid pneumonia, he was put on a ventilator and had a tracheostomy where they could not figure out how to get him off the ventilator due to anxiety. Because of that he was on the ventilator a long time, as a result of that he developed VAP (ventilator associated pneumonia) which stems from bacteria in the hospital and the vent. As you can imagine, my family was not at all prepared for the financial burden that comes along with losing a loved one, like a bereavement period, a proper funeral and burial. That is why I am reaching out to you all in hopes that you’ll hear our story and show your support (if possible). Please help us celebrate his life and support our family in this heart wrenching time. All donations will go to expenses for the funeral and our family as there is an employer who is not compensating for a bereavement period. Expenses include basic monthly bills, funeral expenses and family support. My father passed away in the same hospital I am employed. I cannot even think about going back there, considering the circumstances, at this time, and have begun looking for employment elsewhere. We feel heartbroken, blindsided and unable to concentrate on anything else since this happened a few short days ago, on Thanksgiving Day. This is a huge financial setback and we greatly thank you for all your understanding and support, every little bit helps. We love you dad, so much.         img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61585187_1638242922308144_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61585187_1638242934101029_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61585187_1638242961901561_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61585187_1638242974815405_r.\"   /       img class=\"m-text-editor-image\" alt=\"\"   src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/61585187_1638242995948229_r.\"   /      ',\n",
       " \"  Hi my name is Shannon and I am making this go fund me to raise money to give my Aunt a funeral service. She passed away on Tuesday December 28th at 1:40pm. She had been in the hospital for about 3 1/2 weeks on a ventilator battling covid. Myself and my family can't afford to pay for the service at this time so I am asking if anyone can donate to help us give her a beautiful service. Our Aunt Peggy was such an amazing person, she loved her kitty cats with all her heart. She was never able to have children of her own so her kitties were her babies. Our Aunt loved everyone and especially her nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews. So if anyone can donate to help us out it will definitely be appreciated.

       " \"  On Saturday Sept. 18th my wife's step father Ken was admitted to the hospital for Covid pneumonia. He was put on a ventilator the next day. The following Thursday her mother Crystal was admitted to the hospital for the same reason. She fought hard for two weeks but unfortunately passed away on October 5th. This was all very unexpected and happened very fast. There was nothing in place to help with funeral arrangements and with Ken still in ICU the expenses have fallen on their children. I'm asking for help so they don't have to do it alone. Crystal was a very kind hearted, loving mother and the definition of unconditional love.

       " '  Hello,         My Name is Earl McCune and the lady in the picture is my Aunt Cherie McCune. She is nearly 80 years old and is in the hospital on a ventilator from Covid—19 and isn’t expected to survive very much longer. She has been in bad health for a number of years suffering from the effects of Dementia and Heart Failure.     She had to move in with us a few months ago because she was having trouble taking care of herself.     Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago I myself came down with Covid. I isolated myself and it spread through my household like wild fire. My aunt got Covid and we stared to treat her with OTC medications. She wasn’t having a fever or any other symptom,  just a slight cough. Over a period of a week she wasn’t getting worse and wasn’t getting any better. All of a sudden she had a fever and was really having a lot of trouble trying to communicate. I ended up calling the paramedics and her fever was almost 103 and her Oxygen was only in the high 80’s. They took her to the hospital and admitted her. First few days she was responding well to Anti-Viral medication the only issue was she was still very confused. We started to make plans for her to go to a rehabilitation facility on January 4th as she seemed to be recovering pretty well. Early morning on 1/1/2022 I get a call that my aunts oxygen levels stared to severely dip and she was moved to the ICU. I checked in on her over the phone and couldn’t reach her directly as she was out on a high pressure mask to try and get her oxygen up. I was told she was very agitated and kept trying to remove the mask. I got a call overnight in early hours on 1/2/2022 from the doctor that her condition is severely deteriorating and she needs put on a ventilator. I was told prepare for the worst and she probably won’t make it another day or 2 as she’s starting to shut down.          Im being proactive and started making calls as I was told she’s close to passing away. She has all her final wishes spelled out in her Last Will and Testament. To honor her wishes in her Will it’s going to cost in the neighborhood of $10,000. She don’t have any life insurance because some guy she heard on the radio a number of years ago said she don’t need life insurance. So what does she do? She cancelled her policy. She used to have a substantial portfolio but a lot of the money she did have went to take care of her for the last 5 years since her dementia diagnosis. Before that she spent money on collectibles that in reality aren’t worth very much today.          Any help would be greatly appreciated because she don’t have a lot of money at all. I know I don’t have $10,000 laying around for a funeral I know is coming soon.          I am needing help to raise money for her funeral.     I’m very saddened by this but I don’t know what else to do to help raise the money needed.          I will update as updates come in.  ',\n",

Details to follow.     \\xa0     After surviving a month’s stay in the hospital and two weeks on a ventilator during COVID in March-April of 2020, Jon succumbed to respiratory failure.     \\xa0     He leaves behind his wife of almost two years, Tala, and their “fur baby” husky, Gordo.     \\xa0     Jon loved people at a deeper level than most, especially those often neglected by the mainstream. He had a powerful presence and wore his heart on his sleeve. As a result, no one ever needed to ask what Jon was thinking or feeling. His favorite pastor was Steven Furtick of Elevation Church, whom he and Tala watched online. Jon was a Believer, and we are confident of his place in Heaven where we’ll see him again.     \\xa0     Many people have expressed interest in how they may help, and this Gofundme account will help pay for funeral expenses and assist Tala as she moves to the next chapter of her life. Jon was the sole provider of the home as Tala was recently awarded her Permanent Citizenship--a long-held goal of them both to establish residency in both the U.S. and Colombia.     \\xa0     Jon was an athlete in high school, participating in football and wrestling. As an adult, he was an entrepreneur at heart, starting a moving company, managing up-and-coming hip hop artists, and plans to launch the Yellow Tucan with his wife, Tala. He loved working with his dad in numerous startups as well.     \\xa0     In addition to Tala, his immediate family includes his mother Cheryl, father Damir, brothers Paul, Michael, and Isaac, and sister Mira Paige. He has a nephew, Ivan, and niece, Ilijana, whom he dearly loved, and they loved him as much in return. Jon especially loved his Colombian family and life in Medellin. He leaves behind his father-in-law, Carlos (Papa), mother-in-law, Rose, sister-in-law, Laura, and precious niece, Victoria. He has many extended family members in the Dallas area, including his grandmother, Miroslava (Baba), Uncle Chico, Aunt Angela, cousins Danijela and Luka, Ceca Helen, and Uncle Slavko. His Aunt Debbie and Uncle Andy, cousins Wes, Liz, Nick, and grandmother Mary Beth (Ernie), live in North Carolina, and his favorite Uncle Steve in Oklahoma.

       " '  With a heavy and praying heart I post this. On Sept 6, 2021 the heavens gained an amazing devoted Daughter, Sister, Aunt and soul, Faith Jay. There are so many beautiful memories and stories to be told about Faith-her love for her family, nephews and nieces are just the beginning but the most cherished of her heart. On this very same night of her passing her brother Michael was admitted into ICU with COVID complications. As this family was trying to accept their loss and prayers to Michael, the two remaining women of the Jay family home were rushed and admitted into ICU themselves. Laura with a stroke and brain bleed and Paula,  their Mom on a ventilator with COVID. Both women have prayers constantly going their way to heal and pull through these times. Although the future is unanswered for them at this time, unfortunately the costs of funeral expenses for Faith and their day to day living expense have not stopped. They have animals, rent, utilities and will need extensive medical treatments going forward.     Beyond her own everyday life of raising 6 children and trying to comfort them and herself as they lost their Aunt as well as their other Aunt and Grandmother hospitalized, Megan has graciously taken care of the animals and tried to maintain the home as best as possible right now. This is a terrible, unimaginable time for the entire family and I wish there was more than any collection could do or help with. Power in prayers as the Jay family members conquer all that they are faced with and heal so they can come home and put their precious Faith to rest.     Please share this page and pray as they would do for you and every stranger. Bless you all.   ',\n",

       " '  Hi I am trying to help my good long time friend, Matt Holtzclaw with loss of wages after having to be off from his job 8 weeks with Covid (Delta Variant). He has also lost his mother from getting Covid right around the same time.     Matt works as a contracted  commercial truck driver for Fed Ex. Unfortunately the company does not have loss of wages compensation for getting Covid. Matt had covid that led to double lung covid pneumonia. This had him sick for 27 days and then when he thought he was better he ended up in the hospital with bacterial pneumonia for another 7 days.     He was then discharged from the hospital only to face the tragic death of his mother from complications from covid as well. . She was on a ventilator for 3 weeks with no progress. During this time Matt had to quarantine for another 10 days and then the remainder of the 60 days was being spent making arrangements for his mother\\'s funeral and handling of her affairs from her passing.          Matt\\'s mother passed away on August 14, 2021 at 10:19 AM.  Matt says \"I couldn’t even be there with her in the room when she took her last breath. I had to be on a zoom call but at least I had that because I read out of her Bible some of her favorite verses I prayed with her and I told her mama it’s gonna be OK I love you over and over and over again. It totally broke me!!!! I know it’s not the healthiest thing in the world but I try to avoid emotional things because they affect me so hard but there was no way I could escape this it was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through my entire life! I’ve cried more the last couple weeks that I have in my whole 45 years of being on this earth! The onslaught of mixed emotions that I had was terrible. On one hand I missed my mom who raised me by herself because my dad died when I was 16 and that made me feel selfish on the other hand I was elated with joy and so happy that she did not have to worry about hurting or any of the crazy things that’s going on in this world anymore. She was finally in heaven with God And my dad and her parents and all her other family members that have passed before us and that gave me peace. Even though my mom had a last will and testament  That listed me as beneficiary and executor of her estate and I was her only son really doesn’t matter when it comes to certain things that have to be handled after a loved one passes. Took me over a week to get a death certificate and without a death certificate you just can’t do anything!  I still haven’t been able to go back to work yet and this Thursday will make eight weeks that I’ve been off.\"         So while Matt has been off sick and mourning his Mother\\'s death,  his bills have compounded.

       " \"  Hello We are making this Fundraiser on the behalf Indrel Green we are needing help for funeral expenses.    August 24th 2021 we received a call saying Indrel Green was in the hospital fighting for her life on a ventilator with COVID-19. We contacted the jail to see what was going on and why was no one contacted not even her emergency contacts about her and her health. It was then drawn to our attention that she was released from jail on August 18 2021. So this makes 6 days that we have to find out where is she is and what happened to her, it’s like she is missing at this point and the only help we had was outsiders calling around from jail trying to get messages to us. We called Bell County Sheriff's Department and was told all day yesterday that they have no records of her and that she just signed herself out of the system and bonded out on her own and walked out…that didn’t make sense Indrel knew who to call when she was released she had numbers and she ain’t gone walk no where when her place to reside is to far from the jail. We then uncovered that it was all a lie, Indrel had been very sick for days before they rushed her to the hospital . She was not released on the 18th that she was in fact rushed to a hospital (with 2 other ppl) on August 16, 2021 at 6:09 pm where she got Covid tested and came up positive. The hospital finally informed us that she was cold to the touch and barely responsive when she was dropped off and she been on a ventilator fighting for her life since then. So thats actually 8 days she was fighting for her life and none of her family knew or was contacted. So we asked why was we lied and told that she walked out the jail and posted her own bond we was then transferred to a sheriff who told us that she was took to the hospital on the 16th and that they didn’t want any decision making to be in their hands so they went to speak to a judge and got her released on they own. They knew Indrel was sick, they knew she was passing out on and off from Covid and did nothing until it was to severe and close to death. We just lost our grandma her mother and now we stuck at another cross roads praying for a miracle. That miracle wasn’t answered    Indrel has passed away.         Family was called on 8-28-21 saying she may not make it through the night that they would be moving forward removing the machines that’s keeping Indrel alive. We are asking for any help the Greens just had to bury her mother our Nana on 7-31-21 all funds and proceeds will go to her funeral expenses thank you for reading.  \",\n",

On Friday, January 14th 2022, my big brother, Dr. Jason Sweeney, was taken by ambulance to the Emergency Department at North Central Baptist Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. There, he was diagnosed with Covid 19, and our lives were changed forever.  He was placed in the Covid unit, given oxygen, and treated for his symptoms.         On January 26th his health took a turn and he was sedated and placed on a ventilator in the Covid ICU. Yesterday, Saturday February 5th, 2022, Jason lost his fight against this horrid, awful disease. I was blessed to have the opportunity to travel from my home in Lincoln, Nebraska to be with him, hold his hand, and tell him how much he was loved.         Today I begin the fight to help my sister-in-law, Jeni Sweeney, find some peace and dig her way out of the extreme cavern of grief and debt in which this tragedy has left her.  Jason was a chiropractor, acupuncturist, and Neuro-Emotional Technique practitioner, who transformed lives and was beloved by the many patients he has helped over the years and has now left behind.           Jason was the breadwinner in the family, as Jeni is disabled and can only work part time.  While he took the best care of his patients, he did not have health insurance or life insurance for himself.  I believe my big brother thought himself invincible, even though we have been brutally shown that he was not.         Right now, Jeni is drowning in sorrow, drowning in the unknown, and drowning in medical debt and funeral expenses.  She is responsible for all the ongoing business costs, including rent and utilities, of a chiropractic clinic that she can’t use. I am asking everyone I know: family, friends, colleagues, and everyone who knew Jason, is involved in the Chiropractic community, or has been touched by this horrible disease, to please help our family climb out from under this tragic experience.  Please donate if you can, or share the link to this GoFundMe page and get the word out so my sister can rebuild her life without Jason.  ',\n",
       " '  Hello! My name is Denise and I am raising urgent funds for the King family! Thomas King (55) entered the gates of Heaven on January 2nd due to complications of covid. His precious wife, Marilyn (54), is in the ICU on a ventilator due to covid. This family needs help with funeral arrangements for Thomas, medical expenses, and household expenses. Let’s pull together and help this special family! ANY amount would be greatly appreciated!!!          Thomas and Marilyn King are probably best known for their work for the Kingdom of God. Through the years they have been instrumental in many ministries in the area. Thomas was present, with no questions asked, to help with any construction that was needed. He received great joy in helping keep God’s house looking nice. Marilyn has always had a heart for children. She loves teaching the children about Jesus’ love. Marilyn also loves to make sure that any church dinner looks nice and also that any visiting preacher has a gift basket of goodies. Thomas and Marilyn have two grandchildren that are their world. They have so many wonderful memories together.         On December 21st at 11:00pm Thomas went unresponsive with his oxygen level dropping to 32. 911 was called immediately and he was taken to Novant Medical Center in Thomasville. He tested positive for covid and pneumonia. They started aggressive treatment and he was placed in the ICU. They could not get his oxygen levels regulated so he was placed on a ventilator December 27th. He coded twice on December 28th and had to be shocked back to life. On December 31st his heart rate dropped and they had to work with him all afternoon and into the night to get him stable. On January 2nd, he coded again at 11:30am they performed CPR and were able to bring him back. At this point, they called the family in. His body was under so much stress. Through the afternoon he became stable again so the family left. At 6:18pm, Thomas’ son, Josh, received a call at church that his dad’s heart stopped again, CPR was performed, but it was his time. Thomas entered Heaven’s Gates at 6:05pm. The support from across the country has been overwhelming.         On Dec. 22nd, Marilyn’s oxygen level dropped into the 60’s. Marilyn’s son, Josh, felt the need to call 911. She tested positive for covid and pneumonia as well. She was placed in the ICU on December 22nd. They started aggressive treatment. Marilyn was placed on a ventilator on December 24th. It has been up and down but we are still believing for a miracle. As of January 2nd, Marilyn is stable on the ventilator.         Josh calls every morning for an update that he shares with all the people praying. Each afternoon, Josh and his wife Amanda are allowed to visit. They pray, anoint, and give a pep talk each day. Although we lost Thomas here on earth, we KNOW that he’s dancing on streets of gold in a brand new body.         We are coming together as one body from across the country to help out The King Family. There will be so many expenses that come up and we want to make sure The King Family knows we love them.                  ',\n",

August 16th, 2021 Arturo Villanueva was admitted to the hospital for Covid related pneumonia and was put on a ventilator for 3 weeks before being transferred to Piedmont hospital October 6th where he remained until his family had to make the difficult decision to take him off of life support this afternoon. Due to his condition, Arturo has been unable to work and has consequently lost his insurance to cover his medical expenses and household bills. Arturo was the sole provider to his wife Maria, a loving father to his daughters Betty, Marcela, Becky, and Esequiel as well as a grandfather to Natalia and Emmalyn. This time has been both emotionally and financially draining for the Villanueva family, and they could use help covering medical and funeral expenses. If you can, please consider donating to help their expenses and if you can’t afford to donate please share this link. Please respect the family’s privacy at this time.     \\xa0     If you would like to contribute to the meal train for Betty, Maria, and Esequiel, please contact me (Megan Leigh) directly on Facebook messenger.

       " '  William Mark Mathias passed on 01/22/2022 at 5:53pm. He was transported to Iowa city to the university of Iowa hospital. He was put on a ventilator due to covid. They didn’t give him much time to live with his oxygen levels decreasing. The doctors and nurses were wonderful in making sure that he wasn’t in any pain, that someone was by his side at all times. He will be missed dearly by many friends and family. He can now be in peace with his parents (Cindy Wells &amp; Ray Mathias) and sister (Jennifer Lea Shively). After my mother passed (12-21-2020) due to covid it was hurting him emotionally and physically. He was always smiling and loved to make everybody laugh and have a good time. He was a big collector, from action figures to cards. He enjoyed being around family and friends. The holidays and birthdays the family would have together will be missed. I am his niece (Sierra Shively) reaching out for funding his funeral expenses. If anyone wants to donate it would be greatly appreciated.   ',\n",

       " \"  Hi. My name is Kat and I'm trying to raise money for my brother Ron.  On August 20, 2021, my brother was found blue and unresponsive by a friend. The friend called 911 and started CPR on Ron who was then rushed by ambulance to Atrium Hospital in Middletown, Ohio.  Ron was diagnosed with COVID 19 and placed in the ICU in a medically induced coma, medically paralyzed and on life support. He had an emergency surgery the first night that the surgeon had told our parents that Ron probably wouldn't survive.... but to everyone's amazement, he did!  Ron, over the course of the next couple of weeks,  managed to beat COVID 19, while on life support including a ventilator and feeding tube, 2 infections, pneumonia, dialysis, and paralysis. Ron has lost 66 pounds in those 2 months most of which was muscle.     Ron was released to a Physical Rehabilitation facility on September 4th, 2021 where he continued his fight. It took 7 weeks but he was finally able to come off of all the machines and tubes.  Ron is still trying to regain his mobility. He is at home now but is housebound doing his best to get around using a walker.  He will most likely not be able to get back to work any time soon even though he wants to and is trying his best to get his life back.     Ron and I come from a family of veterans. Our dad and two older brothers were in the Navy. Ron followed suit and joined the Navy in 1985, straight out of high school and served our country for 5 years as an electrician onboard the U.S.S. Nimitz before being honorably discharged.     After going through a divorce, Ron was a single father. The courts granted him full custody of his one year old daughter, who he raised completely on his own. She is now an adult with a family of her own making Ron a grandpa of 3 including twin boys.     Ron is a 5 year member of the Riders For Life Riding Club, 3 years of which he has been an active patch member. The Riders For Life Riding Club are known for their charitable toy drives for the needy at Christmas, charity rides and as motorcycle escorts at funerals for anyone who asks.     Ron also owns a small, local plumbing company but due to the effects of COVID 19, he is unable to run it. Can you please help Ron? He has always pulled his own weight plus he is a veteran who raised his daughter on his own while running his own small business and also raises money for people in need.     Thanks in advance for your help and prayers.    \",\n",

       " 'My father Michael David Hennegan Sr. Lost his battle with covid July 19, 2020 around 6:35am. He fought so hard and it came as a shock when we found out his lungs and heart just couldn’t take anymore. He was such a great man and so strong, he was loved by so many. This is very hard on us all. We want to provide a good funeral for him and we also have to take on his finances.          For those who do not know, my father, Michael has currently been hospitalized on a ventilator fighting severe COVID pneumonia since May 7th. he is now off the ventilator and recovering, This virus has taken a huge toll on his body, his kidneys took a hard hit as well as his circular and vascular system. He will also have to have both his legs amputated they will try to save as much of his feet as they can. He still has a great quality of life ahead of him and has survived a virus that should of killed him.   The financial aspect of his treatment never stops growing as we fight for him to get better. Those of you who know him knows he would give all he had to someone in need, given that he had something to give. To some he is a friend, uncle, brother, and/or son, but to six kids he’s “Dad” and to two sweet little kids, “Pop-Pops,” as their grandfather. His aggressive treatment will continue into the following weeks.  We are hoping to raise $10,000 dollars to help offset him for not working, as he has worked almost 40 years doing the job he loved he will have to give that all up due to his body taking the hit it has and his legs being amputated. we are also having todo many renovations to his home. maybe you cant donate but you know someone who can help in the renovation to help him live a more normal life.  Every dollar counts and is very much appreciated by his family as we hold on to hope that he will continue this fight and return home to us and eventually the life he very much wants to live. It will take about a year for him to learn to walk again and to get back to the things he loves.  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389233834786_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389233834786_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389263221367_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389263221367_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389479998556_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389479998556_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389619286002_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389619286002_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589389657698880_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589389657698880_r.jpeg\"     /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_158938968620059_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_158938968620059_r.jpeg\"     /        img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48049172_1589400520331234_r.jpeg\" alt=\"48049172_1589400520331234_r.jpeg\"     /   ',\n",

Tragically, this time, his results came back positive for COVID-19. He was immediately put on a ventilator to help him breathe, but as his symptoms worsened, he lost the fight against the virus and passed away on July 3rd.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Renes\\' passing came abruptly, shocking us all with how fast this virus took his life. He had celebrated his 50th birthday with his family three days before his surgery. He was dancing and singing with his daughter and wife. There was no indication that in the days to come he would fall so ill. For those of us who knew Rene, it would be an understatement to say that he was the life of the party. He was constantly smiling and cracking jokes. It was impossible not to notice that he was in the room; he always made it known because he was just that loud. He made an impression on everyone he met. He loved going on random adventures with his family, whether it was something as simple as going to the grocery store, sitting outside on the porch, or driving across the country. He enjoyed his family time. He did all of this while being completely blind. He is survived by his children Emily (22), Rene Jr (19), Justin (17) and Emma (21 months) and his wife Gabriela Menchaca. Rene is also survived by 8 brothers and numerous nieces and nephews. He was preceded by another brother and a sister.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0As the pandemic continues, we feel for all families who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, unable to be there in the hospital with your loved one is something unbearable. Rene did not get to have the comfort of family around him in his last days; however we want to honor him with a funeral that celebrates his life. That cannot happen if we do not have the funds. We are asking if you can donate any amount to our fund, share this with friends and family and continue to spread the word. We are grateful for any amount you can contribute, thank you everyone!\\xa0',\n",
       " '  My mom and dad had such an amazing life together. They were true soul mates.    Derek was so amazing to my mom. He was always surprising her with flowers and going overboard on gifts for each special occasion. They had a beautiful life together.         It is with a heavy heart that we are asking for your help again.         My Dad has been battling and fighting for his life since April when he tested positive for COVID. He was hospitalized and put on a ventilator for two weeks, then had to have a tracheotomy. They gave home a 1% chance to live. Guess what? He made it! He beat the odds.         He was in the hospital, then sent to Post Acute Medical unit, then to riverside Nursing home.         So he was hospitalized since April and recently got out Aug 1st. He couldn’t walk on his own, he couldn’t dress himself etc. My mom took care of him and Derek would always say to everyone that she should get a medal.         Recently my Dad had some complications and was rushed to the hospital and went into cardiac arrest for 25 minutes which had left him with severe brain damage.         He passed away Wednesday August 18, 2021 at 11:11 am. I hate to put this right out there but i have to her this going as we have to get things set up.         Unfortunately he didn’t have life insurance or anything to have a nice and proper funeral that he deserves.         Please if there is anything at all you can give to help my Mom and our family it would be greatly appreciated!!!!!  ',\n",
       " \"  Edwin Yu was a beloved son, loving husband, and proud father of 2 children.     He was hospitalized in December 2020 due to COVID. For several weeks he was on a ventilator fighting the virus, but by a true miracle, Edwin survived his battle with COVID. However things were still difficult for him in the weeks after he was COVID free. He had suffered a heart attack at the hospital and had to have a tracheotomy so that he could breathe easier after the virus wrecked his body.     Eventually he was transferred to a nursing facility in Topanga from February to March. During this time my mom and I visited twice a week (even though we were only allowed one a week) bringing him food and spending time with him during his rehabilitation. But we could only ever see him through a glass window, and with every visit his determination to come home grew more and more.     By the end of March, his doctor gave us the ok to have him come home. It was nothing short of absolute joy that he experienced being surrounded by his family in his own home these last couple of months. My brother, Tyler, flew in for 2 weeks to celebrate his birthday and care for him alongside my mother and I. We thought that even if it was a long journey, he would get better and we as a family would do anything to help in his healing.     But as May came around his pain grew to be too much. He experienced neuropathy pain all over his body as well as difficulty breathing due to COPD. But he still tried to keep a brave face telling extended family there was nothing wrong. Only those of us at home could hear his aches and complaints as his body failed him. He may have survived COVID, but he never truly healed. The virus did unimaginable damage to his entire body, and although he wanted to keep fighting, even the strongest survivors grow weary from relentless pain everyday.     Looking back after the shock has settled down, we realize that maybe he knew his time was almost up. Our family never considered that he could leave us so soon, but he was the only one who truly knew the extent of his pain everyday. Edwin found solace though by living the last couple of weeks to his fullest. He ate all his favorite foods, enjoyed his signature Starbucks drinks, and watched all the movies he loved in his youth. He loved his wife who cared for him 24/7, and continued to dote on his children who were never far from his reach. If he was going to live, he was going to live his way.     Despite the tragedy of his passing, Edwin was home. Since the moment he woke up in the hospital to the second he left the nursing facility, all he wanted was to be in the home he built and made with his family. He deserved more time, but God was gracious enough to give him enough to come back home to us even for a couple months.     We created this GoFundMe to help us relieve the financial burdens of handling his funeral. It is painful enough to lose him so soon, but he wouldn't want us to drown in debt to honor his memory. Funds will go towards all funeral and memorial expenses in the coming weeks. Any additional funds we receive will help us care for our home as Edwin was the main provider for the family. The last thing he could ever want is his family losing our home. If you could open your hearts to helping our family in our time of grieving, we would be immensely grateful.  \",\n",

       " 'My name is Sammy Aleman my mom passed away on 01/01/21 due to complications\\xa0 (heart stopped)from covid-19. It was sudden and truly a shock that this virus ripped through her so quickly.\\xa0 I\\'m still in shock, heartbroken and devastated. I couldn\\'t even see her before she left us due to covid-19.\\xa0 She did have funeral insurance but it was barley enough to cover just the funeral costs. She was married too and her husband Armando is in the hospital now as well with covid-19. Sadly, he is now on a ventilator and we are all hoping for the best. While all of this is heartbreaking, life has to go on and bills have to be paid. Sadly my mom had no savings that i could find. I have had a lot more expenses than I thought outside of just the funeral costs. I\\'ve had many calls, texts, and Facebook messages about how people can help, so this is why i created this go fund me. This has all been very hard for not only me and my family but for the community as well. My mom knew a lot of people and she helped a lot of people. I mean a lot of people, more than i could ever imagine! She was always full of life and optimistic about almost every situation. Im really gonna miss her, and words escape me to truly capture everything I\\'m feeling lately.\\xa0 Goodbye and I Love you Mom! tell Mario i miss him too.  For those of you who wanted to know if there was going to be a service, say this time there will not be a funeral service due to cost and covid-19. Too many people would show up for the service and I will not be able to able to live with myself if someone got covid-19 from that event. I was planning on having a memorial service via zoom very soon. My mom wanted to be cremated and scatter her ashes by the tree she would climb in lake geneva. Once it gets warmer, we will be heading up there to do just that. And if things are better with covid-19 every one will be welcomed. Please feel free to share your story or pictures of my mom with me via email or on here or on Facebook.  Thank you everyone for your time.  I will be writing this in spanish shortly, i just wanted to get this done sooner than later.   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610164196793807_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610164196793807_r.jpeg\" /   img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610164934322866_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610164934322866_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610164948666880_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610164948666880_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610164990807594_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610164990807594_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_161016500921887_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_161016500921887_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610165027211669_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610165027211669_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610165817804403_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610165817804403_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_161016583117434_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_161016583117434_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610165851327871_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610165851327871_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_161016588766331_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_161016588766331_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610165907918110_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610165907918110_r.jpeg\" /  img src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/53819006_1610165932418311_r.jpeg\"     alt=\"53819006_1610165932418311_r.jpeg\" / ',\n",

       " '  Chad Wohlgamuth passed away on January 4, 2022 and his family needs our support to help with medical bills, funeral expenses, and everyday expenses including mortgage, electric, gas, water, car loan, food etc. Chad didn’t have a pension for the family to receive money.  Due to medical reasons he was not able to perform the job duties at his previous job so he went back to college and started a new job about 3 years ago. We are asking for any help that you are able to give, no amount is too small. The goal is to give this family $25,000.00 to help with all the expenses incurred as a result of Chad’s unexpected passing.          Chad (Woogy-Bear) was just 48 years old when he got a diagnosis that he could not prepare himself or his family for.  On December 1, 2021 Chad tested positive for Covid. On December 7th his wife Marie had to call the rescue squad to take him to Mercy Health St Rita’s as Chad was struggling breathing. He was diagnosed with bi-lateral pneumonia which was caused by Covid. On December 10th Chad was put on a ventilator and was completely sedated and was not able to communicate. He was allowed one visitor a day for only 30 minutes which was his wife, Marie.  The hospital staff told his wife that it would be a lot of ups and downs and would be a roller coaster, that is exactly what it was. It started off by Chad having to be on 100% oxygen to him showing improvement to then taking several steps backwards. Chad had to start dialysis through this process as his kidneys started shutting down. During his final days he was also maxed out on 2 blood pressure medications. His wife stated that during this whole time that there wasn’t a day that Chad didn’t show her he wasn’t fighting even during the final days and she also fought by his side every single day and prayed for a miracle. Marie had to make several decisions through this journey including the hardest decision she will ever have to make.    Chad was the father of 3 daughters and a paw paw to 3 granddaughters. His youngest daughter passed away on January 10th, 2003 when she was only 14 months old.   During Chad’s funeral Chad’s daughters and wife wrote letters that were read and we wanted to share part of these letters as they describe what kind of person Chad was and shows how much he will be missed.    “A father’s love is patient, kind, humble honest, forgiving, faithful, and selfless” “He was always the cool dad” “He was and is a good man, a family man” “my mom’s best friend and the best paw paw to my girls”    “Always loved me for who I was, encouraged me to be who I am and always has been my #1 supporter” “you’ll always be the first man I ever loved and the first hand I’ve ever held” “thank you for being my superhero and the best friend a girl could ask for”    And Marie writes, “You have not only been my husband all these years but also my best friend” “ You have always been my rock” “I have always admired your dedication to our daughters and granddaughters” “You have always been an inspiration for me to be a better person” “Thank you for showing me that we were worth fighting for” “Goodbyes are not forever, Goodbyes are not the end, They simply mean I’ll miss you until we meet again”    Chad has impacted so many people throughout his life and he will be missed by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Please help us honor Chad by helping his family in this time of need.  ']"
